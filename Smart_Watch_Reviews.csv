B07L1GWR66,Watch A,John ZambranoJohn Zambrano,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat value for a budget smartwatch!,3-Apr-23,"This is my first experience with a smartwatch, so I can’t make any comparisons to other popular smartwatches. But with that said, I can tell you that the S3 has quite a bit to offer for the price, but in my review I’m only going to touch on the features and apps that were most useful to me after using the S3 for a couple of weeks.𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀• Price: About $50.00 or less if you catch it on sale (a fraction of what you’ll pay for a smartwatch from Apple, Samsung, Fitbit, etc.).• Fairly easy to use with a variety of built-in apps.• Comfortable to wear.• Very good battery life.𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀• The companion app for Android & IOS needs improvement.• Minor functionality issues with some of the apps.𝗚𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱: The S3 comes packaged in an attractive box and includes a watch strap, charging cable, and a small, printed user manual. The printed manual will prompt you to install the companion app (Tozo Health) on your mobile device where you are stepped through a setup routine that is pretty straightforward: creating an account for Tozo Health, pairing the S3 with your device, and entering your physical stats (i.e. height, weight, and age) – this data is used as a basis for some of the included watch apps. I had no problems paring the watch with my Samsung phone.𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲: Overall the build quality seems good: the watch is mostly plastic although I’m not certain about the watch crystal covering the screen (it could be glass or a high-quality acrylic material). The watch strap appears to be made of a soft, rubber-like material that was comfortable on my wrist (I could wear the watch for hours at a time without it becoming uncomfortable) – I also appreciated that the strap pins have these little protrusions that allow you to retract the pins with your fingers for inserting the strap into the watch itself (no need to use a knife or a spring bar tool – a very nice touch). I also appreciate that the watch is waterproof (“IP68 waterproof” according to the online product description) as I sweat profusely when exercising (especially outdoors in the Central Texas heat)! The S3’s screen can be controlled by touch and is quite responsive. The watch crown also has some functionality when you press it, although it does not appear to do anything when you twist it around (at least not in my experience – perhaps this will change with future updates). I also found the screen to be bright enough for viewing outside in bright daylight. The S3 comes with a charging cable that is different from anything else I’ve seen before: one end plugs into a standard USB socket (computer or USB charger) and the other end connects to the bottom of the watch via two metal contact points that are held in place with tiny magnets on the end of the charging cable.  I’m not sure why Tozo went this route instead of using a standard USB-C connector – my concern here is that if the charging cable fails then you will have to obviously obtain another one from Tozo. In any case, I didn’t have any issues charging the watch with this cable and it didn’t take very long to get a full charge which lasted well over a week (with a mix of casual usage and running the exercising apps) before needing to charge it again.𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝘀: The S3 has built in apps for various exercise routines, health monitoring (e.g. heart rate, oxygen, sleep, stress level), weather, music playback on your mobile phone, making calls on your mobile phone and viewing text messages/notifications, and other utility apps (such as an alarm, timer, and stopwatch). There is also a “Find Phone” feature that will ring your phone in case you misplaced it, but this only works if the Tozo Health app is running on the phone, so it may only always be useful. A calculator app would have been nice to have. Oh, and did I mention that the S3 also functions as a wrist watch? 😊I do a lot of walking (both indoors and outdoors), so the apps for these activities were the ones that I used the most. When walking or running, the S3 will calculate and record your steps, calories burned, distance, average pace, average heart rate, and other metrics as well. When used outdoors with the Tozo Health app it should show you your location (based on GPS data) when the app is configured to use Google maps, but I just couldn’t get this feature to work even when giving the app all the permissions it required on my phone. If you choose not to take your phone with you while walking or running then the watch will still display and record your exercise data then later sync this data with your phone automatically when you reopen the app. Interestingly, I found that the outdoor walking app seems to overcalculate my steps. I tested this several times by walking to my neighborhood mailbox which is about 210 steps one way from the front door of my house (about 420 steps round trip, give or take a couple of steps). The watch consistently calculated this anywhere between 450 and 460 steps. My guess is that the S3 is calculating an average step size based on my physical height that I entered when setting up the watch. I tend to take larger-than-average steps when walking, so perhaps that is accounting for the difference. I also noticed that the watch didn’t seem to accurately monitor my activity when walking on my treadmill – I couldn’t figure this out until I read the following in the manual: “when doing outdoor sports without continuous arm swing , such as riding, please turn on the exercise interface in the app, which will record your exercise data more accurately”. So I take this to mean that the watch relies on detecting arm movement when walking or running – this is a problem for me because I always keep my arms stationary on the treadmill handrails, but the solution provided in the manual does seem to work as described, so overall this is just a minor gripe.The music control app worked fine for me but not with every music app that I tested on my phone (the S3 was able to control two of the three music player apps that I have installed). And using the phone call app on the S3 was a mixed bag: I was able to answer incoming calls using the watch and initiate outgoing calls using the dial keypad on the watch, but I could not initiate outgoing calls when selecting any of the 10 contacts that I imported into the watch from my phone (the S3 would act like it was dialing the contact but would then quit and go back to the contact list). I really liked the heart rate monitor and it seems fairly accurate (I tested this against taking my own pulse manually) and the watch will give you a constant average heart rate while exercising – very useful to ensure that you don’t go over your max heart rate for your age.𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: My favorite option here were the watch faces that you can display on the S3. There are several built into the watch that you can instantly switch between as well as many others that you can import from the Tozo Health app, however, I was disappointed that the S3 only seems to allow you to retain one imported watch face from the app (i.e. it only seems to keep the last watch face that you import). I would like to see this improved as well as having more watch faces added to the app (animated watch faces would be nice).𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Overall I really like the S3 (especially at its price point) and have no problems recommending it as a budget smartwatch, but there is room for improvement and some bugs to be worked out, especially with the companion app since the S3 relies heavily on it. I’m hoping that Tozo continues to develop its line of smartwatches which I think are a great value.𝗨𝗣𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘 𝟬𝟵-𝟭𝟲-𝟮𝟯: I recently noticed that an update for the Tozo Health app was available in the Google Play store, so I installed it and found that the Google map feature now works in the app when walking or running outdoors. I still cannot make outgoing calls on my phone using the contacts that I imported into the watch, but at least it seems that Tozo is being responsive to updating the app, so I'm hopeful that some of these other minor quirks will be worked out in future updates."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,KenatugKenatug,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsTerrific smartwatch and an amazing value,4-Sep-23,"I have been a customer for several of Tozo’s excellent earbuds, and was offered the opportunity by Tozo to try out their S3 smartwatch. I took them up on their offer and would like to offer my take on the watch and how it compares to another smartwatch I have, the Fitbit Versa 3.Let me start out by saying that the Tozo S3 is an amazing deal. At a price that is a fraction of the price of the Fitbit, it is hard to believe that Tozo can put out a watch of this quality at the price at which they are offering it. While there are a few things that the Fitbit can do that the Tozo cannot, for the most part the Tozo can do everything most people are going to need.Here are some positives and negatives:POSITIVES:1. The battery life has been great. It is at least double what I get from the Fitbit. I know there are a lot of factors that influence battery life, and there are some things that the Fitbit can do that impact battery life that are not an option on the, such as the ability to have a power saving setting that still shows the time constantly. I do use that setting, and I’m sure that impacts the Fitbit battery life. But that feature is probably not needed by most people anyway, and the battery life on the Tozo has been very impressive.2. The display is crisp and clear and set up logically. The physical button on the Tozo makes it easy to get into the menu system. Although it does not appear that you can tap the screen on the Tozo to wake it up like you can on the Fitbit, the wrist action setting works well.3. The app is excellent, and there are lots of option in the app to add many different exercise routines. More than what is available on the Fitbit.4. The Bluetooth phone connection works very well, and I was able to place and answer calls without a problem. Not unexpectedly, the sound is tinny due to the tiny speaker involved, but it was still clear and very usable.5. They have many nice watch faces available for download for free, and I found one that shows all the information on the main screen. It’s nice that they give you so many options.6. The Bluetooth connection was easy to make and works well. No problem making or maintaining the Bluetooth connection.NEGATIVES:1. I like to keep track of my heart rate, and while the screen does show the heart rate on the different exercise routines, the heartbeat readout is very small, whereas it is much larger and easier to see on the Fitbit. It is not easy to see without having to bring the watch closer to you. On a personal level this is probably the biggest complaint I have with the watch, although it would not stop me from buying it. If Tozo sees this review I hope they will consider increasing the size of the heartbeat readout, since it appears that there is plenty of room to do that.2. There is no GPS. I am listing this as a negative here only because this could be an issue for some people who are walking outside and want an accurate distance calculation beyond what the watch can do on its own. The Fitbit does have GPS. Of course, I’m sure that is one of the things that accounts for the big difference in price. For me the lack of GPS is not an issue at all, since my exercise is all done indoors. If that is your situation, then you would just be paying for something you don’t really need with the Fitbit.3. The Fitbit has a read out that shows what they call “Active Zone Minutes”, which takes into account your heartbeat level to determine how good a workout you are getting. I like that because I can tell at a glance how good a workout. While the Tozo does show you what percentage of time you spent in each heart rate zone, it doesn’t have this additional calculation to show you a combined score using what Fitbit calls their “Active Zone Minute” readout. While this is certainly not a dealbreaker by any means, this would be a great addition to the Tozo if they could do it.I don’t want to put this as a positive or negative, but potential purchasers with small wrists should be aware that the watch is fairly large. That, or course, is a positive in terms of the amount of information you can put on the screen, but if you have small wrists (like I do) you might want to consider one of the smaller Tozo smart watches if you plan to wear this all day. I only wear the watch when I am exercising, so it’s not an issue for me, and I like having the larger screen. The watch and the band are both comfortable. Just something to keep in mind if you have small wrists.Overall I think this watch is an incredible value. I don’t know how they can put out a smartwatch this good at this price. As long as you don’t need GPS I would certainly recommend giving this watch a try. I have been impressed with Tozo’s earbuds, and what I found with this smartwatch is consistent with that. I recommend this product highly."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,jeriscjerisc,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Smart Watch for a Greater Price!! Month After Review!!,5-Jun-23,"I bought this watch a month ago & like to get at least a month under my belt with any new electronic before giving a review.Pro:* Wireless connection is via Bluetooth and has a fairly long range, about 30ft.* Great watch for basic needs sure as making phone calls, getting text & notifications, health info (step counter, heart rate, stress test, blood oxygen level, breathing exercises, sleep tracker & tester).* Phone calls sound really good. There is a small speaker built into side of watch, side opposite of side control button. You can hear person speaking pretty good & speaker has 6 levels of loudness. I have been told I sound better talking with watch than my phone.* Weather app that is pretty accurate & gives you basic weather forecast for current day & 3 days out.* Multiple different backgrounds pre downloaded & also customerizable your any picture you have. I have my 2 dogs on mine & love it!* I don't know the exact battery size but mine lasts about a week on one charge. I wear mine everyday & mess with it on a regular basis. When you do need to charge watch, only takes about an hour or so to charge.* Display is very clear to see & has 5 levels of brightness. Screen is decent size (approx. 1.25"" x 1.25""). I wish it came with screen protector but not a make or break by no means. If you swipe up on the main screen, there is menu that has multiple controls such as brightness adjustment, do not disturb / silence phone, find my phone feature ( your phone will ring like someone is calling), low power mode (power saver for watch) & settings button.* Watch band is silicone & very comfortable for all day wear. Sometimes it is a little difficult to latch but don't take long at all to get use to it.* I have had a few times were the watch got wet & one fully submerged for a sec. The watch still works just fine so I would dare to say that it is water resistant to a certain extent. I would not be worried if I got stuck in the rain with my watch on but remember to remove before you go swimming. Lol!* I can control my music on my phone, car stereo, etc when using music on my phone. I can go forward, backwards, pause & volume.* You can set up reminders & alarms. I can set up drinking water reminder, get up & walk reminder, & many more.* Flashlight button that lights up whole screen bright white. You wouldn't think it's very bright by looking at it, but in complete darkness, it really does help.* The watch comes with a USB charging cable and the charging port on the inside of the watch connects very quickly.* You have full access of your watch through the tozo health app. The app really helps you customize your watch and gives you access to all of the watches features.Cons:*Would be really cool if the watch was totally waterproof but for the price, it is water resistant enough to hold up to most light water situations.* The home band is nice but it would be nice if you could buy different bands.* You would think if it allows you to access music on your phone, sometimes, you could access your songs all the time. Since there is a speaker on your watch, why can't you listen to your music through your watch?* The USB charging cable is fairly short as in a foot. Would be really nice if the cable was at least twice as long. The charging port on the back is magnetic however, the magnets aren't very strong at all. The watch becomes disconnected very easily. Needs stronger magnets or the ability to clamp or plug into the watch.* When the watch does disconnect to your phone due to your phone, being out of range of the watch, would be nice if it would automatically reconnect once you were close to your phone again.* When you get messages that are or include pictures, it would be cool if you could view said pictures on the watch. On the same note, it would be really cool if the watch had a talk to text feature. The watch does have quick reply options that you can program with the app.* The calling button has favorites that you can set up with the app and a dial pad, but it would be really cool if you could also access your contacts from your watch.Well, That is pretty well. Everything I can think of after owning this watch for a full month now. If anything changes, I will definitely put up an update review.Overall I really do like this watch and especially for the price, it really is pretty impressive. I would definitely buy it again and recommend to anyone that is looking for a basic smartwatch with slight upgrades. I Hope this review helps with your decision making and happy bargain hunting to you all!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Kenny AdamKenny Adam,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis Watch is Phenomenal. It's a great Purchase or Gift.,6-Jul-23,"Personally, all of these features are Awesome, the band even tucks itself away under the other band so it's not sticking itself out, it's hidden, PERFECTLY. I'm most impressed with the Sleep Monitor. I'm very attentive to watching the quality of my sleep patterns and depth of my sleep as well. This watch does it all.Another wonderful feature is the fact that when I'm busy doing something and I receive a phone call or a text, guess what?? I can answer the call/look at the text right away on my watch and don't really have to stop what I'm doing. That's a HUGE plus and a definite step up from the last watch. It's super impressive and vitally important to have the opportunity to answer or decline the call coming in and also to look at that text message and possibly immediately call them to talk or reply right away to the message. It's super AWESOME!!! Thanks so much Tozo!!Now, the Health tracking features that's another huge plus, every watch maker these days is trying to attempt to make this easy for everyone. Tozo is right on top of it too, the Sleep as previously explained is Awesome. Now the walking, standing and calorie burning aspects are excellent for everyone to be able to watch and see where they're at as well. All of the Exercise Option tracking, has an indoor/outdoor walking, running and cycling. Other outdoor activities include the Hiking, Yoga, Dancing and a Stepper. It will basically cover each and every single aspect of your fitness work out. I personally DON'T do everything in the watch, but I do try to do most to see how it tracks and it's pretty darn close to accurate, so I'm Thrilled to monitor everything from my wrist. I also can look at the records of what I've done, simply because it has a record log for me to look at. Even more impressive.Now for my Heart Monitoring, My Blood Oxygen Levels, My Breathing and My Stress Level ... In addition to my Sleep that I previously commented on ... It's Fantastic as well. This watch is just the Best. It's Not too big, it's fitting for either a man, woman or a younger crowd. The others I've seen are larger, heavier and are meant for bigger people. This is totally light weight and AWESOME!!!! Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, adding a different screen design is SIMPLE!!! If I can do it, you can too!!! Thanks again, sorry for the length of this, but I wanted to touch base with you on everything.All in all, I give it a 9.3/10 based upon it being TOTALLY COOL!!!Thanks so much Tozo for keeping up with Technology at its finest. You Are AWESOME at what you do!!!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,DrewDrew,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI use it way more than I ever thought I would!,7-Jan-23,"I’ll admit that I have always loved technology and “toys”, however as I’ve aged I have become less impulsive to buy the latest and greatest. Instead, I’m now much more conservative and patient before I make any purchase. As far as smart watch technology is concerned, I’ve been eyeballing and following the evolution of the bigger name fruit 🍎 brand for many years but have never been tempted to invest due to their pricing structure. When I recently saw the Tozo S3 go on sale at a ridiculously affordable price, I took some time to read close to 100 (out of over a 1,000) of solid reviews and made my decision to buy it. All I can say is I’m ecstatic with this purchase! I’m surprised that I use it aa often as I do every day, and also find some of the overnight monitoring features useful like tracking my sleeping patterns (so insightful!). In terms of how I use it during a workday, my number one love is the fact that I can subtly monitor incoming text messages at a quick glance without my actions being obvious to my work colleagues. Previously, I’ve been criticized at meetings for glancing at my iPhone too frequently during inappropriate times and replying to text messages. This watch allows me to see the incoming messages at a glance (most of which do not require an immediate reply) and to stay informed, which is maybe overboard to some, but a necessity to me. Blame it on my personality LOL 😂! And then I reply to the text messages that require a response later on my iPhone when I have a break or spare time. I read one reviewer who said he wished he could respond to the text messages on his watch. To each their own but I am sooooo glad I’m able to monitor the messages and grateful I’m unable to reply. Keeps me “well behaved” and forces me to stay on the down low. Battery life is simply magic. Easily lasts 2-3 days with high usage and charges up FAST! I have zero complaints and am still experimenting with many of the features, hence this is the end of my review. Oh, two last things: I love using the flashlight feature at night when I don’t want to disturb others in the house when I make a late night trip to the bathroom or kitchen, and also love using the alarm which wakes me up with vibration and doesn’t disturb anyone else. This is far from a complete comprehensive review, as I’ve still yet to try out all of the features but so far so good. Everything I’ve tried works the way it should and I’m happy with this bargain priced smart watch that is chockful of features!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Josh,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsIt sure is a watch,8-Mar-23,"I'll be honest, I only grabbed a smart watch because I was in the market for something that didn't run out of sync with real time. I figured grabbing something cheap would suit my needs and for the most part that has been true. I do have a few gripes though, so I figure I'll outline them here.Battery life is far from the advertised 7-10 days that is stated in the description of this listing. In my experience, I've charged the watch to 100% (which admittedly is very fast), gone to work, and after a 12 hour work day the battery ends at roughly 25%. With a little tinkering, specifically lowering the screen brightness, I was able to achieve 45% battery life by the end of the day. Unless you're willing to disable the activation gesture and run the watch at minimum brightness, you're only going to get 1-2 days of battery life at best.The app is not horrible. The Google App store lists that no data is sold to third parties which is good. There is an option to not log in and run the app in ""Guest"" mode. You are required to download the app in order to activate the watch.The sleep tracking in my experience does not work. I got it to detect that I was sleeping once, it said I slept for one hour when I slept for eight that night. I've worn the watch to bed for a full week at this point. Rather lackluster.The timer and stopwatch features are disappointing. To get to them, you need to wake the watch, press the button on the side to open the menu, open the Clock menu, select either stopwatch or timer, and run the stopwatch or timer from there. You can not run the stopwatch or timer in tandem; If you leave the screen in which they are running, they close and reset. This is a step back from basic digital watches that allow you to run both at once.The weather data that it gathers is very inaccurate. No option to grab data from other providers. My default phone weather app is much more accurate and reliable. The music page works well for showing media information and allowing control from the wrist, but it is inconsistent when it comes to updating the information at times and it's also very clunky to get to being hidden in the menus.The notification feature is clunky, with some apps (notably Uber) spamming your wrist with vibrations while the app is running. I've opted to disable notifications for the most part because of this. Phone alarms will not be funneled to the watch. Instead, the watch has it's own alarm system, allowing a maximum of 5 alarms. I could not find a reliable way to enable some sort of alarm passthrough. Feels like an odd oversight.The watch face selection is not as helpful as I'd have expected. All seamed to be geared towards showing heartrate and burned calories statistics. Some have step counters on them. None that I have found provide weather information or music information at a glance. A lot of them are visually distracting or not intuitive to read at a glance.The heartrate tracking and step counter are probably the best part about the watch. Both seem reasonably accurate, I haven't had any problems with them. The ""Find My Device"" features are also very useful, allowing you to use either your phone to find your watch or your watch to find your phone. It does this by vibrating and playing sound from either your phone or your watch. Not something many will use often, but definitely a good option to have in your back pocket.Overall, it's functional. Considering the cost, it seems to be worth the value despite it's flaws. It doesn't feel cheaply made. The strap is comfortable, the watch is light yet sturdy. The touch screen functions adequately. The dial on the side serves no function other than to be a button. Spinning it does absolutely nothing, pressing it in is it's only function. The button does have a very satisfying click, and it does not feel weak or flimsy. I have not tested it's alleged IP68 dust and water ratings, so I won't give a definitive review on that front, but I will say the quality of the materials at least makes it plausible on my mind."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,B. Chang,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsA speakerphone watch, finally!",9-Oct-23,"I've been a user of a Samsung Gear Neo 2 almost since it came out.  I'm still using it almost 10 years later.  The main reason I got this watch is because I needed a speakerphone.  I'm a mechanic and work on cars a lot and reaching into your pocket when your hands are dirty to answer your phone will cause all kinds of problems.  I've been on a search for a replacement watch for some time.  Tozo introduced their S2 watch several months ago, but it didn't have a speakerphone.  I got it anyway to see if I could live without a speakerphone and I wanted to have something to measure my stress levels.  I liked the watch, but without a speakerphone, it was still missing a key feature.  Now with the release of the S3, I was pumped.  To its credit, the speakerphone works well.  I haven't used it as much as I would like, but the times I have used it, it's been fine.Here are some things that need to improve.The speakerphone will only work if the call is initiated on the watch or when an incoming call is answered on the watch.  If you want to switch to the speakerphone on your watch, it won't connect.The ""contacts"" feature requires you to add people to your contacts list on the app and there's no way to search, so you just have to scroll until you find the name you're looking for.  It doesn't appear that they're in a logical order either, so good luck with that.  You're better off searching on your phone and dialing it on the watch, if it's that important to you.These next features, I've been trying to wear both the S2 watch and the S3 watch at the same time to see the differences.  Here's what I've noticed:The S3 stress measurement is significantly bent toward relaxation.  If I know I'm stressed, the S2 will show elevated stress in the 70s or 80s.  The S3 will show normal 40s and 50s.  Right now, the S2 watch shows a 83 which is really high, probably because I'm frustrated with the poor functionality of this watch and rehashing it is stressing me out.  The S3 shows 29.  Calm.Sleep tracking is too sensitive to what it thinks is wake-up.  If I get up to get a drink of water in the middle of the night, it will think I woke up and slept for 2 hours, when I was in bed for much longer.  I don't think it's ever resumed tracking my sleep if it thought I woke up.  The S2 is better.  The S2 thought I slept 11 hours last night, I really only slept 9.  The S3 thought I only slept 1.5 hours.  I think the sleep feature would be better if I could tell it I was asleep.Conclusions:The features of the watch are a little lackluster.  Messages, calls, notifications and the like are better handled on the Samsung watch, but I would expect it to be considering I have a Samsung phone.  But, if you don't have a smart watch and you're looking for one, I think this would be a reasonable start for anyone."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Jeff G,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsNice Upgrade!,10-Oct-23,"I got this as an upgrade for my TOZO S2 smart watch and it's been a really nice upgrade with some great new features. The watch is also comfortable to wear and has great battery life.The first thing I noticed with this watch was that it uses a new, completely redesigned app. After pairing my watch it had me install a firmware update which was done after just a few minutes.I've been using this for a few weeks and I've been noticing the battery life to be really good. With the default settings out of the box the battery life was right around a week. This included the default wake gesture that turns the screen on whenever you turn your arm to look at the screen. I found the gesture to be pretty accurate - it turns on every time you move to look at it, but there are lots of times when you move your arm for other reasons and tends to use a bit more battery life than necessary. There's also a ""do not disturb"" mode that will disable this during certain scheduled hours that you set, like when you're sleeping. For the second round, after recharging the watch for the first time, I disabled the wake gesture, since it's easy enough to just hit the button when I want the time. This extended the battery life to what's looking like will be 2 weeks or maybe even more (right now I'm still at 39% after 12 days). So the battery life is shaping up to really be very good.My favorite new feature that the S2 didn't have was the speaker and microphone for answering (and making) calls right from the watch. Whenever you receive a call the watch vibrates and shows a button for accepting the call straight from the watch. You still have the option of picking up your phone and taking the call that way if you want. I found that the call quality was actually pretty decent. When I answered a couple of calls from my wife on the watch I found we were able to hear each other well. You also have the option of adding favorite contacts to a quick call list you can access directly from the watch, as well as a list of recent phone numbers or contacts, so you can easily initiate a call to those numbers directly from the watch. I found this to be pretty handy.Another note is that the screen resolution appears to be a bit better than what I had on the S2 watch and it's very responsive. Lots of other improvements to the software on the watch and it has some other features like alarms, timers, stopwatch, etc. The step tracker seems to be accurate. It has a pulse monitor which seems to be pretty good but I haven't benchmarked it. It also measures blood oxygen level which is pretty cool. It also has activty/workout tracking, but I haven't used those much. I believe it uses the GPS on your phone to show your walking/running/biking activities on a map. I haven't done much of that yet.Another plus is that the charger for the S3 appears to be identical to the one I used for the S2. So now I have a second charger which is pretty convenient.Overall I've been really happy with this watch and it's been a nice step up from my previous S2."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Shamly Mackey,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsBest bang for the buck!,11-Sep-23,"Wow! Where do I even begin? I recently purchased the TOZO Smart Watch, and it has been an absolutely transformative experience! For the price, the array of features it offers is just mind-blowing!Firstly, the health monitoring capabilities of this watch are top-notch. It accurately tracks my heart rate in real time, providing detailed insights that help me optimize my workouts. The sleep tracker is another stellar feature - it doesn’t just track the duration, but delves deep into the quality of my sleep, giving me helpful data to improve my sleep patterns.The exercise tracking features are thorough and precise. From counting steps and calories to measuring the distance covered, this watch is like having a personal fitness coach on your wrist. It even measures blood oxygen saturation, ensuring that I’m always aware of my physical state, making my workouts safer and more effective.Connectivity is seamless with the TOZO Smart Watch. It syncs effortlessly via Bluetooth to my smartphone, opening up a world of convenient features. I can control my music, check weather updates, and even use the mobile search function directly from the watch. The compatibility is impressive, working harmoniously with my device, and the TOZO Health app is user-friendly and a breeze to navigate.The battery life has also been exceptional. It lasts up to 10 days on a single charge, ensuring that I’m never left without my watch when I need it most. Plus, its IP68 waterproof rating means that I don’t have to worry about water damage, be it while swimming or sweating it out during a workout. It’s the durable companion that has supported my active lifestyle wonderfully.In conclusion, purchasing the TOZO Smart Watch has been one of my best decisions. It offers an incredible range of features at an unbeatable price, and it has genuinely enriched my pursuit of a healthier, more active lifestyle. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable, feature-packed, and affordable smartwatch!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,hardwear31,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsComfortable design and excellent value, but screen/button input could be better",12-Jan-23,"I am pleasantly surprised by the set of features offered by this smartwatch. I've been wearing it for a couple of weeks and the size and weight of it on my wrist feels natural. I love the strap it came with and how it tucks away the extra length. Battery life is excellent even with continuous health monitoring. The software handles pretty much anything you'll actually use on your wrist - calls, timers, music control, etc. - without being a miniature version of your phone. If you're used to fitness trackers and want some more ""smart"" features, this could be a great option except for a couple of key points on usability that I'll note below.It's overall an excellent gadget but here are some things I don't like about it. Sleep detection has been inconsistent - it sometimes does not recognize a full night of sleep but it also seems sensitive enough to record short naps. Personally, I think sleep tracking is the most important health monitoring feature. Second thing I disliked is that although this device is waterproof the screen does not work well when wet. Instead of becoming somewhat unresponsive to input when wet, it actually starts doing random things like adjusting settings and making calls. Related to that, once you wake the device, there's no way to turn off the display manually until it times out - during which time, the touch input is extremely sensitive including when a sweaty sleeve brushes up against it, or you're actually trying to dry the display to use the screen. Lately, the screen wake gesture expects a sort of aggressive movement that doesn't feel natural to me - I end up using the button on the side often.I would recommend adding a double press feature to put the screen back to sleep using the button. Maybe even turning off the wake gesture if you long press on the second press, or a setting where double pressing is required to wake the screen. This way you can feel more comfortable with the fitness tracking aspect of this smartwatch when you're out doing activities - especially if you're using included features like timers, stopwatch, music controls, etc.Overall, for the price, this device provides a lot of value. With a little refinement, it could become really amazing."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,FB,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWill get the second S3!,13-Feb-23,"I bought this to replace my other smart watch that was dead in swimming pool after I used it a little over 12 months, just right after the warranty expired! I have had some Tozo earbuds and I really, really love the sound quality (and durability) of those earbuds, so I'm giving Tozo's smart watch a try. So far, I'm really impressed with this good-looking watch. It connects easily after I downloaded the app. It is bright and the colors are so clear and pretty, indicating the high resolution of this watch.I love the accuracy of the mileage and calories in this watch after I compared it when using treadmill. It feels really nice and light when I wear it for both outdoor and indoor running. The watch provides more than 100 sports that you can get from the app; but I downloaded only 7 sports to save more storage and avoid possible lagging. Oh, the watch is super responsive and it feels very comfortable to navigate.Hundreds of different watch faces give me lots of options on which I want to use as my watch's 'wallpaper'. Also, I really appreciate the productivity features, like the world clock and reminder, that not all smart watches include. Find my phone feature is also cool! I have been using the watch for more than a week, and the battery still ridiculously has 60% (I don't use the watch for calling or listening to music, though I still receive messages from it). My wife's Apple watch only lasts less than 1.5 days, with similar usage pattern! My Tozo's earbuds also have long battery life, and I'm really glad that Tozo brought this important aspect to their smart watch as well!Another thing that I love from this product is that Tozo gives 18 months warranty for this smart watch (vs 12 month warranty to their earbud products or most smart watch brands out there). I'm sure Tozo will honor this as they did to their earbuds when I got some issues. At least I know that Tozo's customer service is super responsive, and this gives me more assurance for unexpected future possible issues. Definitely an extra point for Tozo!I'm getting another one for my wife, who was planning to buy an Apple watch 9 to replace her short-lived apple watch. Good thing she hasn't bought that newer version. In conclusion, I'd recommend S3 if you're looking for a sport smart watch with good battery life, supported by longer warranty and great customer service.  I've no regrets buying this!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Joe Tairei,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsA nice knockoff, good to tide you over until you get the real thing",14-Sep-23,"I have been using a Fitbit HR but the display is annoyingly small and it's hard to find all the features. I heard people were making pretty decent Apple Watch imitations these days so I decided to try one. For under $30, this one is not terrible.It has a nice, bright display, decent battery life (after a day's use, I find it is still around 87% or 90%), and feels comfortable on my wrist. The band is some kind of silicone that is pleasant to the touch, and the screen is smooth and feels quite refined and responsive, compared to older smart watches.Its main health features are the heart rate and calorie counter, along with step counter. I have not found these to be particularly reliable. When I am on a cardio machine at the gym, sweating and panting, and the machine is telling me my heart rate is 145 (that's my typical workout HR), the watch is stuck at 70 for some reason. Eventually it usually does reach the 140s but is strangely slow.The calorie counter is also useless; if I run for 70 minutes, I have almost certainly burned at least 700 calories, but the watch tells me 450 or 500. That's not a credible calculation.The step counter only works when my arm is swinging. On the elliptical, although my arm is moving back and forth, the counter doesn't seem to register most of the motions as a step. If I'm on the tread mill but holding onto the bar, it also doesn't work. I have to be actively swinging my wrist. Not of much value.As a watch, it's great.The app is a typical mediocre Chinese mobile app. It wants you to put in your Google login and access to contacts etc. I refrained from doing this, and I would recommend others also refrain. You're handing your valuable credentials over to some random company in China; do you trust them? It will accumulate your health data in the Cloud, connect it to Google Health etc. Your medical records are stored in some China server. Just say no. It's not worth it. If it were Apple or Samsung, I'm willing to trust that they respect my privacy TO SOME EXTENT. But a rando knock-off product, nope!So it is a useful timepiece, it looks good, is accurate, and the health sensors are mediocre. That's what you get for $25. If you want a real piece of class, obviously you will need to spend hundreds more."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Smartwatch from Tozo!,15-Aug-23,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He's very selective when it comes to smartwatches. He's very picky about the features and he loves this watch!First the design is excellent. It absolutely rivals the looks of watches that cost hundreds of dollars. He also loves the display and that it has more features than his old watch. It's lightweight, and he can really customize it to his liking. The built-in Bluetooth call function allows him to make and receive calls directly from his wrist.The health tracking features are accurate. He can monitor blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and track his sleep patterns. The fitness tracking options are fantastic lets you really track your activity and not just have to guess. He does outdoor activities and LOVES how many options there are.Setting up the smartwatch with his phone was easy. He has a android phone but it also works with iOS phone too. The user interface makes it very easy to navigate through the various features and settings.overall, this watch feels like a high price device stylish and comfortable that's also within almost anyone's budget. It has truly enhanced his daily routine. If you're in the market for a well-made smartwatch with all the features that doesn't break the bank, this is the one to get! Highly recommend to anyone seeking a smartwatch that rivals the big-name brands with ease!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Mark LawlessMark Lawless,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI love the watch and it's very well lit.,16-Jun-23,"I have so many watches from Rolex style watches to Garmin Golf GPS watches.  I love this watch since I can make calls and receive calls with it.  I can control the music streaming on my phone, I love that the brightness on the watch is easy to see in full daylight.  Setup of the watch and phone is easy to do. The heart rate monitor is nice for me to have, I will be doing a lot of exercise since I just had an operation and I need to get back into shape after that. I love the watch faces on the watch as well. From basic good clean screen to lots of data all in one screen.  The watch has a speed dial function where you can store your favorite 10 numbers for fast dialing or go to the call log to dial one of those numbers. As I said I have lots of watches but this will be my main watch, if it had a golf GPS built in it would be all I would ever need in a watch.  I hope I can find some screen protector to protect the face of the watch, since I'm pretty rough on my watches.  Another nice thing about the watch, it charges very fast.  Great when you go to put the watch on and you find the battery is almost dead, something I've had to tend to with my Garmin Golf Watch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis watch is a GREAT bargain!,17-Sep-23,"TLDR; the feature set of this watch at this price make it a FANTASTIC bargain!The positives:  Heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking both work very well, and give results similar to those I get when I use my LG watch, which I find reassuring.  I'm still figuring out how to use the watch to initiate and answer calls, but when I have used it the audio is clear on my end and for the people who I've spoken with.   Battery life--I find it amazing that this watch, with sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and every other feature enabled consistently went 4 or more days without requiring a recharge.  My last watch barely made it through a single day.  Comfort--the band that comes with the watch is very comfortable, much more so than my last watch.  I was prepared to hate the unusual ""tuck through"" means of securing the end of the watch strap but in fact it has proven very comfortable.  I think the comfort of the strap is the reason I can sleep wearing this watch when I've found others to be too uncomfortable to wear to bed regularly.The negatives:  Lack of available apps--I'm used to wearing watches with WearOS or other operating systems that have large catalogs of apps available to run.  The choices are limited for the S3 but seem to include options for most of the apps you would want to run to support the watch features.  Notification management--I get *lots* of notifications on the watch, probably because I enabled too many of the apps on my phone to send them.  The annoying thing is that I can't seem to delete notifications individually, but rather can only choose to delete all the notifications currently appearing on the watch.  I assume this will be addressed in a future software update.  You need to have the TOZO app running on your phone in order to receive notifications and use the ""find my phone"" featureOverall impression--this is a GREAT watch for the money.  It can't compete yet with top of the line watches in terms of available apps but from a feature standpoint it comes amazingly close.  I think this watch would be more than adequate for casual smartwatch users, and would make a great first smartwatch or a backup watch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,S. F.,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsNot what I expected,18-Mar-23,"I will start this by saying I received this as part of a promotion. So the watch looks like an apple watch, the fit is pretty comfy. I'm just going to make a pro con list for everything else.Pros:-It tells time.-It has a flashlight.-It has a timer.-You can set alarms.-It has reminders to take meds, drink water, move.-You can answer calls on it.-The speaker and microphone are pretty phenomenal, you do not need to hold your arm at your face.-You can see your notifications, if they are long you won't see all of it but still helpful.-It reads your heart rate, stress and oxygen levels.-You can customize your watch screen to be a photo.-This thing really holds a charge. I have gotten more than 10 days out of the first 2 charges. The third charge is holding over 3 weeks but I'm not wearing the watch lately.Cons:-You cannot text on this watch, you can only quick reply and only to numbers that are NOT in your contacts.-While you can make outgoing calls, it will not call out from your selected contacts, you have to physically dial the phone number and if you don't have it memorized you may as well just call off your phone.-The exercise tracking is way off, like thousands of steps off. I wore this watch and my fitbit for 2 weeks, pretty much 24/7 charging them at night as needed. I did workouts, I went on walks, and everyday the step count was off. I did over 2 miles, almost 6k steps on my fitbit, the watch recorded 2800.-There is an option to play music, buy you have to start it from your phone and if you pause it more than a couple seconds you have to start it back from your phone again, so kinda pointless.-You cannot connect any apps on your phone to the watch, they are almost entirely separate.-This last one may just be me but the band gave me a pretty nasty rash on my wrist and I have not been wearing it for a few weeks now. But I have super sensitive baby skin.In conclusion:This is a pretty good watch for the price point, it is a neat little gadget to have so long as you don't expect too much. I did enjoy my time wearing it, I sanitized the band and after my wrist clears up I will try it again."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,bswizbswiz,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsIncredible value!,19-Dec-23,"I bought this mostly to replace an older Fitbit Versa that has a dying battery.  I have pretty simple needs when it comes to a fitness tracker/smart watch, and the Tozo S3 delivers what I am looking for.  Like all Tozo products, the S3 comes packaged very nicely.  The watch itself is larger than the Fitbit I am used to, but it is lightweight and not cumbersome at all.  The build and screen quality are extremely good for a product at this price point.  The display is bright with dark blacks and vivid colors.  I really like the feel of the band, it is a sport-style material but somehow doesn't feel as rubbery/plasticky as my Fitbit bands. Other reviews have mentioned the loose end of the band tucks inside so it doesn't flop around, which works fine for me.The feature set is good.  Step tracking, SpO2 measurements, sleep tracking (not tested), text/call/app notifications are all there.  The step tracking, for me, seems not quite as sensitive as my old Fitbit.  If I walk slowly around, it doesn't always register but the difference vs Fitbit is minimal.  You can set the S3 to give you a reminder to get up and move if you've been sitting for too long, but it's not as granular as the Fitbit.I miss some of the Fitbit features, but I can't deduct any stars because there was no implication that they were included in the S3.  The big one is the automatic activity recognition where if I go on a long walk or bike ride, the Fitbit will realize it and assign to the proper category of exercise.  The S3 requires manually starting an activity if you want it to register as a bike ride or whatever.  I also wish the S3 had integration with Google Fit so I could use it to have more access to my data outside of the Tozo app.  There is a screen in the app to enable Google Fit integration, but it fails every time I try.  Hopefully this will be fixed in an update.So, all in all, the Tozo S3 checks all of the boxes for me as a 'basic' smart watch user.  I do miss some of the Fitbit software features, but considering the S3 is about 1/3 to 1/4 the price of a new Versa, it's not really a fair comparison.  For what the S3 sets out as its core features, it works extremely well and the value cannot be denied.  Recommended!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Lola,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsAnother SCORE for TOZO!,20-Aug-23,"At this point, I'm thinking of buying as many TOZO products as I can afford, just to make sure I have them before they start raising their prices.  After 3 pair of earbuds and a smartwatch - all working great and doing exactly as advertised - this company will start to become way more popular.I got this watch for sleep tracking. My other activity watch is a Samsung Galaxy Fit2. It was ok, but the last update now has the watch tracking even the smallest movements, so it looked like I was waking up a lot in the night. I wanted to compare it to another watch, so the price of the TOZO was fine. The TOZO shows movement, but not as much as the galaxy. Either way, I do like this watch and the other functions that it has. Plus, the controls I can use ON the watch (the Galaxy is mostly all through the app).  I like all the watch faces I can use, but so  many of them I'll never use.  It's still got a lot I do like.Battery life is good."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Yashiv R,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsVery good with a few nitpicks,21-Jun-23,"I liked a few things about this watch. For me, I prefer a device that can record fitness as well as heart rate and also inexpensive that I won't feel a great loss if damaged or stolen. I'm not a fan of getting calls and messages on my phone so I won't speak much on that.Firstly I think the price is unbeatable for what you get.Battery life is also solid, I was able to get a week out of this watch without charging.The size is great especially for a fat person like me, it's not small to look ridiculous but persons with smaller forearms may find it big. It's also pretty rugged but when in water it does operate spontaneously at times. The app has a fair amount of faces to choose from so I'm sure you can find one or two you'd like.I did not like the band that comes with it. I personally don't like these bands where the band has to fold under itself. I will replace this band soon.I also did not like when using the software it continuously prompts me to pair for calls and messages. I wish there was an option to disable that. Otherwise the software is pretty ok for my purposes."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Steve ,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsVery Cool Gadget,22-May-23,"For the bargain price I decided to purchase this watch to get familiar with smartwatches.I used the exercise app for jogging and walking and it is very accurate compared to my older Garmin, it also has the time display while in the app unlike the Garmin.I can’t believe it has all these health apps for such a low price!The battery life last about 5 days but this is just using it like a health tracker and not phone call.I have made some phone calls with the watch and audio and voice are very clear but you must have your phone close by because it’s connected through Bluetooth.The other cool feature is find my phone for people that misplace there phone it is a huge feature (make sure your volume on iPhone is not turned right down or you won’t here the bell sound).One caveat is that when the battery completely depletes you need to sync your watch back with the phone through the app on your phone.Overall this is a great gadget and at 1/10 of the price of an Apple Watch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Dad&mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome smart watch that bangs the buck!!,23-Nov-23,"This S3 is a very solid upgrade of the S2 Pro that I have been using:1. Brand new app TOZO Health, a great improvement on TOZO FIT that comes with S2.The navigation is very smooth and friendly, one-click the side button will lead to the toplevel navigation menu which can also preset as list view or grid view; swipe horizontallycan shortcut to some common health monitor item like Heart Rate, Activity, Sleep (the graphic reportof the deep sleep vs shallow sleep is very helpful); Blood Oxygen is awesome - these common healthmonitor item readings seemed to be quite the same as the readings from what the hospital nurse did.Drink water and Stand up reminder are really helpful.2. Sports/exercises activity: quite a ton, even include those not common ones like Tai Chi, at least to me.But you'd need to remove at least one from the default 10 items in order to see more and add yours if not includedin the default ones -- this is kind of inconvenient and hopefully can be improved. Otherwise it's very awesome.I added 'free style' swimming and either in the indoor swimming pool or the lake outside, it recorded well andunder the water I can see the screen clearly as long as I wake up the screen by wrist gesture3. Phone call is awesome: I was impressed - I was in the lake about 20 yards away from the shore where my cellphoneresided, and I was able to call from the contact list and both sides can hear clearly. Guessed the bluetooth signal mustbe strong as well. This is really convenient and I didn't have to get up to the shore from the lake in order to makea phone call.Haven't tried out all, but messages(text, email, apps), music app(mainly YouTube music in my cell phone), very rich watch face selections, etc.,  all seemed to work very well.This TOZO S3 is a versatile smart watch with solid quality, no brain choice with this price! Highly recommend it!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Mordecai25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsVery nice, inexpensive smart watch",5-Oct-23,"I've had this watch for about a month and a half.The most impressive feature of this watch is the battery life. I've found that I can realistically use most of the features consistently for about 5 days without a charge. There are some features that you can enable/disable that will shorten or extend that duration, but I consistently got through the work-week without needing to charge it. When a charge is required, it charges VERY quickly - usually around 20, no more than 30 minutes.The phone feature works well. I don't often feel the need to use it - I prefer not to have a conversation with my wrist - but the few times I did use it, I was told that I sounded very clear and I had no trouble hearing the person speaking.The step counter, heartbeat monitor and oxygen saturation monitor seemingly worked well. I found myself checking these levels more than I thought I would. I certainly like that I can look through my history and make a comparison from days or weeks past.The app is fairly intuitive and easy to use. I haven't had any problems with it and there were a few features that took to some playing around with to reveal - but all in all is solid and stable.The ONLY complaint that I have - and it's important to note that I have an iPhone - is that texting (reading or sending) was not a feature that worked for me. I understand that iMessage and text are different, and I imagine that is the issue., but I'm also not going to disable iMessage in my phone settings so I can see texts on my watch. And to be fair, I did not disable iMessage to even experiment to see if I could get the text feature to work.All in all, I assessed 5 stars because, for the price, it is a nice, well-designed and comfortable watch. It has all the features of a much more expensive ""activity tracker"" for a fraction of the price. To me, that alone makes it worth it."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,hojo1990hojo1990,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsExactly what I need, I small problem",4-Nov-23,"My fitbit batteries never seemed to last. And this watch not only had great reviews and does everything a fitbit does. I've had multiple fitbits over the years and they are all fairly easy to set up and customizable. I love my Tozo headphones so I am familiar with the brand. So narrowing down an alternative was easy enough. And it wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg if the batteries died. Set up, and getting started was easy enough, and I like all of the different face settings, and all of the bonus functions work great.However, here's my issue... I cannot change the time setting from a 24hour clock to a12hour clock. And I am finding that INCREDIBLY frusterating. I am not military I so not function is 1300... and I cannot find where I can change it. Even YouTube has not been helpful. I would think if this device can do ALL the things it already does then having that simple option would be right after ""select language"".So literally down a while star because of the ONE function that makes this a watch and I can't tell the time without having to do math 🤣 first... stupid, but very abnoxious."

The rotating bezel serves as an intuitive navigation tool, enhancing user interaction.Its water-resistant design adds versatility, making it suitable for various activities. The battery life is generally good, providing a day or more of usage, depending on settings and usage patterns. Integration with Samsung smartphones ensures a seamless experience, allowing users to receive notifications, calls, and control various apps directly from the wrist.Overall, the watch is a reliable and stylish smartwatch offering a range of features for both daily use and fitness tracking.

B07L1GWR66,Watch A,KatKat,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsNice Watch,19-Nov-23,"I ordered this watch because I was jealous of my fiancés new smart watch but I wanted to order from a company that I trusted so since I had ordered wireless earbuds from tozo before and they are still going strong I opted to try their smart watch and honestly no regrets so far. It's been about a week since I got it I've only had to charge it once, it's battery life is really good and I love that it tracks my blood oxygen when I need it to because I have some breathing problems. My only qualm is that sometimes in the morning it'll add a bit more sleep when I know I was awake so I'm not sure if it's because I lay still or something but it's really not that big of a deal and I doubt it will skew the tracking too bad."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,M. A. D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsPretty good overall - great value.,15-Nov-23,"The battery life seemed to be much better than the S2. I was able to get nearly a week between charges.Heart rate monitor works as expected. Calorie count was there but I didnt really pay attention to it or verify the accuracy.The sleep monitoring function was the most interesting. From what I remember through the nights I was monitoring it's pretty accurate for the light vs deep sleep. It didnt once register REM though - not sure of thats something that could be fixed with a software update or not.The app didnt take too long to sync with the device and it was nice to be able to track things over time.I didnt use the call answer function because I'm always wearing earbuds, but the dial out function worked after my contact was entered as a shortcut."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,A. Blanchard,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWhat a great addition to my life!,15-Oct-23,"Update: I've had my watch for over a month and convinced three more people to buy one for themselves. I compare my sleep score every day with one friend. It is wonderful for keeping me up on my feet every hour, for tracking my steps, my sleep, and my standing. I still love it and highly recommend it!I only got this two days ago, but so far, I absolutely love it! I'm 73 and trying to stay healthy. I need to pay attention to my sleep and my exercise and this will really help. I keep finding more cool features of this watch, like I just found it has an ""effective standing"" measure that tracks how often you stand up for at least a minute per hour. As we age, this is very important. I'm excited to track my sleep and to try to improve my deep sleep and REM cycles by trying different things.You can't beat this little beauty for the price. Now if it just holds up, I'll be thrilled.  My only ding is that it took me way too long to figure out how to have a 12-hour clock on the face instead of a 24 hour. I don't want to know it's 18:00. I want to know it's 6 PM. There aren't any easy-to-find directions for that. But other than that small glitch, I'm thrilled with my TOZO!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,RNF,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Value in the Smart Watch Market,14-Nov-23,"I came across this watch when my Apple Watch broke the glass and I wasn’t going to immediately replace it. I was looking for something in the meantime since I am so use to wearing a watch.TOZO makes great audio gear and I thought I’d look to see if they had a watch available. I was pleasantly surprised and perfect timing that I found it.The display is bright, responsive and offers a wide variety of options to your display desired information. The look is very similar to the Apple Watch and the construction is well made. The battery also lasted a few days which was a bonus.Don’t expect a direct replacement if your an Apple Watch user, but for a 10th the price this watch is packed with features the far exceeds any other value smart watch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSurprisingly Good Smart Watch,9-Oct-23,"I purchased this watch a few weeks ago to use as a “work” watch as I was always afraid of damaging my expensive smart watch while doing manual labor.  I figured that if it got damaged, I didn’t have much money invested.I was torn with my expectations, they were low based on the price, but then again, it’s a Tozo product & everything I have from them has been stellar, especially the ear buds.  After a few weeks of use, I am extremely pleased with the watch.  How can they make something that works this good for this price?Pros:  Great battery life (several days of normal use per charge) Bright vivid display that can be seen in sunlight The ability to use as a speaker phone. Good sleep tracking Controlling music via bluetooth The pulse meter works really well for me.Cons:  The charger is a little difficult for me.  It attaches magnetically and I have a tendency to knock it loose.  I wish it clipped on or that the magnets were stronger. The weather app only shows temperature in Celsius.  Yes, I know 90% of the world functions in Celsius, but I still haven’t adapted.If you are looking for a smart watch and don’t need a brand name status symbol, the Tozo is an exceptional device with very few minor negatives."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Thomas,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsDecent Entry Level Smartwatch,13-Sep-23,"Ever since my Fitbit died a couple years ago I have gone back and forth on getting a new smartwatch/fitness tracker. Upon doing a search recently I came across the Tozo S3. I have used a couple different Tozo items over the past few years so I thought I'd give it a try.Overall I'm happy with it. The battery life is great. I always charge it when I shower after my workout in the morning and it has only once gone below 75% between charges. I do not have it set to the maximum health tracking settings, but I have enough to be happy. (You can set the sleep tracker to a higher battery use setting to get REM sleep but I don't need or care about that stat).It fits my wrist well and is comfortable. I do get phantom buzzing because of the screen being pressed by accident, but that's on me.A couple complaints:Tracking of hiking/walking/biking routes is not great. I have to try to start the workout multiple times before it finally figures out where I am and sometimes it loses the tracking in the middle of the activity.The app is not intuitive when it comes to managing your workouts, such as not being able to figure out how to delete a duplicate workout.Speaking of the app, it's just fine. You have to use Tozo's app and it's connectivity is very limited. If you are looking to get a smartwatch that connects to all your apps this is not the right one.As a basic fitness tracking smartwatch, I would highly recommend this one. If you are wanting something more like an Apple Watch this is not for you. I'm happy with this watch overall and would recommend as an entry level smartwatch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,BobPeanut,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat features and an incredible price!,25-Aug-23,"This smartwatch is an incredible bang for the buck, considering it offers all of the features of a $200+ smartwatch at a small fraction of the cost. While other smartwatches (in the $500-800 range) may offer more health monitoring or come pre-loaded with offline maps, the vast majority of users don’t need those features. This watch has a great touchscreen, heart rate monitoring and pulse ox, sleep tracking, accepts phone calls, does fitness tracking, and has an impressive battery life. If you’re looking for a smartwatch that has all these basic features and don’t want to spend a lot, I doubt there’s anything out there that offers more value than this watch.Here’s a list of the Tozo’s features and my impressions of using them:* Heart-rate monitoring – The watch immediately picked up my pulse and was quite accurate. I compared it to a Garmin Fenix 6 and they were consistently within a few bpm of each other.* Distance tracking, step count – It was generally close to other smartwatches. It’s a little less accurate than my Garmin Fenix 6, but that’s not surprising given Garmin’s forte is GPS tracking. Still, the difference was not enough to make a meaningful difference.*Charging/Battery Life – 0-100% charge in about one hour. The battery lasts for days (maybe 3-5) with all the health features enabled (heart rate, pulse ox) and would last much longer with those turned off. Very impressive battery life considering it has a full color display and health metrics!* Touchscreen – The screen looks great, can be very bright, and the touch responds quite well.*Fitness Tracking – The watch comes with a wide variety of fitness activities (various running and cycling, hiking, dancing) to track and seamlessly incorporates your distance and health metrics into it. It doesn’t have as many fitness tracking options as a high-end dedicated sportswatch (e.g., you won’t find less common activities like skiing, snowshoeing, kayaking) but that’s not an issue for most people.* Phone calls – easy to make and receive phone calls. It needs to be connected to your phone via bluetooth for this feature to work.* Phone app – After downloading the iphone app, the watch seamlessly connected and stays up to date.Very impressive that Tozo made such a fully-featured smartwatch at this price point!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Aaron,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsA good smart watch for the price.,27-Sep-23,"Overall, I am satisfied with the TOZO S3 Smart Watch.  The step tracker is reliable and it even measures stress and heart rate accurately.  The app itself is simple and quite easy to use.The only complaint I have is the sleep tracking feature.  At first I thought it did not work because it continued to tell me to make sure to wear the watch while sleeping even though I was.  Even though I do not wear the watch too loosely and follow the instructions, it was still not picking up my sleep.  I went so far as to tighten the watch one night so that it left an imprint in the morning, but it still did not work.  Then, I went on vacation, and even though I set it back to a comfortable position, it started reading my sleep.  After more testing, from what I can tell is that the watch does not do a good job of picking up when you are sleeping if you work the night shift and sleep during the day as I do.  It was able to pick up my sleep every single night when I was on vacation, but could not pick up my sleep when I slept during the day even though it was still able to pick up heart rate and stress levels.  Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase as I can calculate my sleep hours manually, and would definitely recommend this product for anyone on a normal sleep schedule."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Jillian PankoJillian Panko,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat for Simple Tracking,13-Nov-23,"Only had this for a day and I already really enjoy it! The app for your phone is simple to use and auto syncs with the watch. Size and weight is perfect, it doesn't feel heavy on my wrist. Thw notifications are nice, I have mine set for texts and Snapchat and they come in sometimes before they come in on my phone! Getting the bands on was a little difficult as the pins are quite small. It also was auto selected as 24hr time instead of 12hr so had to change that in the app. I wish there was more customization with the face - I like some of the options/designs but wish I could add the features I want. Overall, I really enjoy this!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,SJ Soh,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsLots to Love (3.5/4),5-Oct-23,I’m such a fan of TOZO so I jumped at the chance to try out the smart watch. Many of the features you’d want in a smartwatch are on this watch at a fraction of the cost of Apple and Samsung (how do they do it?!). I’ve been wearing an old Apple Watch for a long time so I just needed a couple of days to get used to the ever slight differences for the way the interface looks (similar but slightly different is way harder for me to adjust to than when something is completely different). My favorite feature is the battery life. I tried wearing this Watch all day and also at night to track my sleep and I was able to keep my watch on at all times for over 4 full days without a charge. I’ve used the watch now for almost 2 weeks and the only thing I’m really struggling with is the charger which is a bit challenging for me to connect properly - the two prongs under the face I seem to have trouble keeping it connected. I’d like to give this a 3.5 (but rounding up to 4 for now) only because the charger thing has not gotten easier for me. But perhaps for someone else the charger is easy peasy.
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Kenny,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsIt’s okay to start out,20-Nov-23,"I have trouble wearing this watch since I never wear a watch before so this is my first. But I got hand of it so it easy to use, display is easy to change through the app ( even though the app has low rating on the apple store). Tracking I would say it’s okay, since It only tracks your arms movement as for walking, I still rely on the phone for walking. Other than walking, calories, blood oxygen, stress level, sleep is great. When syncing with apple phone (health app), it doesn’t sync much and hard time tracking stuff (or maybe it’s just me)."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Benjamin,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood Watch For a Good Price,15-Sep-23,"I got this watch for free. I can say, there are a lot of great things to say. this is a solid price for the amount of features this thing has. Good displays, good battery life, fitness tracker. It also connects to your phone and can make phone calls and texts way easier to see. I really like the addition of a breathing app. It is made to help you take deep breaths for a short period of time (great for monitoring stress).Also, the waterproofing on the smartwatch was sick. I took this thing to a friend's pool, and they were like, ""Dude, don't you need to take that off?"" and I was like ""No, it's waterproof."" Coolest guy there.If you do get the watch, you should also get the app. In the app, you can customize the face of the watch to be some better displays than the defaults. My favorites out of the ones available on the app were the watermelon face and the photo face. Fun fact: you can just straight up make your clock face whatever you want. I downloaded a picture of Snoopy from the Peanuts to my phone, and *BAM* stuck it on my smart watch using the photo theme (life hack for the day). Honestly, knowing that you can just make it whatever is kind of nice. Also while you are in the app, you can change your time to standard time (my watch came in 24-hour time for some reason, IDK), and also check your overall fitness and well-being.I've never really owned a smartwatch, but I have many friends who have them. Tozo is out here yet again looking to make the things that big companies are and making them reasonably priced with the same amount of features. Nice work, guys!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Joshua E Gossett,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsLots of improvement on this model,13-Oct-23,"This is the newer version of my watch and I like it a lot better. Setup was a breeze. The way the watch is organized now is so much better. There is a ""health"" icon that stores info on HR, stress, blood oxygen level, sleep and menstrual cycle. It even includes an option for a deep breathing exercise. I particularly enjoy this new feature as it's a great way to add in breathing if you notice your stress levels are high.The new organization allows for a tab to start and record exercise and a separate tab for exercise records to check progress and help improve walking/running times.I've found the calories burned to be pretty aligned with my peloton and fodd tracking apps and that is helpful.You can change the watch face directly on the watch now - so much easier than using your phone. And there are many options for displaying time, data or both.I don't use my watch for text or call notifications so I can't speak to that.Overall, it's more intuitive in the way it's organized, has very practical apps and is quick to toggle back and forth between the data I'm looking for.This is an excellent watch!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Jason,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood features that work in 99% of the situations,1-Sep-23,"My teenage daughter was the recipient of this watch and offers these thoughts:""I’ve had the watch for about 4 weeks and I actually really like it. It is light enough so that I don’t feel like it’s bothering me, but has a big enough screen that makes it easy to read/use.  I’ve found that all of the features are very helpful, and honestly all work pretty well- no big complaints. One thing about the heart rate monitor is that on the home screen it will show one number, and a different one on the main panel for looking at all of the heart rate stuff. Not a crazy issue, but I never know which one is accurate. Sometimes it will sync up but not always. I like the alarm feature, also- a good extra push when my phone alarm isn’t quite enough. The call feature, to my surprise, works surprisingly well. I’ve only used it twice but the recipients have both said that the volume and sound quality of my voice is good, and it is the same on the watch. So as long as you’re connected to your phone, it’s the perfect solution (and the watch rarely disconnects). The same goes for the “find my iphone” type feature, and has been useful a couple of times when I lose track of it. The one thing that I have found consistently annoying is that when you get a notification, if you can’t read the whole thing, you are able to click on it and scroll to read more, but you can’t do so as it pops up on the screen. To be able to click and scroll to read more, I have to press the side button to “exit out”, and then go into my notification center, click, and THEN read. It isn’t a crazy deal, but the convenience of that feature, and the watch itself seems faulty due to this issue."""
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,J. C. Zimmerman,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsFeature rich and affordable,21-Nov-23,"I wear this watch everyday in a tough work environment. It's primary job is to notify me of messages and incoming calls because quite often my hands are tied up and I'm unable to pull my phone out of the holster. This watch allows me to check at a glance whether I need to drop what I'm doing. Battery life is acceptable and the health tracking features are an additional benefit but not what I bought the watch for.For a simple tool used to keep my hands at work, and my phone in my holster, it does the job quite well."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Ivan P.Ivan P.,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood value daily watch,8-Sep-23,"I received this watch and I have been able to use it day in and day out for 2 weeks and here's my findings:Pros:- looks very nice for the price range- sits very comfortable all day long- battery last around a full week with a single charge- display is bright enough for outside use- is very customizable with phone app- Bluetooth connection is fast and easy- screen resolution is good and not low and pixelatedCons:- gps accuracy is not good, ran 1.6 miles and only registered 0.46- screen will turn off and there's no way to set this off.- I have notifications enabled but have not see any being displayed in watch.- some features require the app to be opened on phone to work (find phone, music) even if running in background alreadyThe watch is a good buy and most of the issues are fixable with software updates. The screen going off might sound silly but when you are running for time and the only way to activate the screen again is pressing a button, that's distracting from the training effort taking time off and messing your pace. Additionally, during features like the gps and the stop watch, the screen will go off and if you press the button will pause the timer forcing you to start touching the screen during a run which again, mess your pace. Features like these should be on the entire time so the runner can just see his time/pace without any interruption while running. Other than this, as a daily watch, works perfectly."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Nikki Weaver,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood watch for the price,26-Sep-23,"This is my third purchase. I've owned 2 of the Tozo S2s and each have broken within a year on the watch band connector, it's chipped away when switching bands. The watch itself still works, but is not useful since a band will not attach. I looked for a different watch as a replacement, but ended up ordering the new S3 since I loved the stress tracker and sleep tracker on the S2 and with the added new feature of taking/making calls on the S3. However, I purchased the premium protection plan this time in case the band connections break. I've had the S3 about a week now. The call feature works well, messages come through, and there's an option for quick responses. My biggest complaint is the stress tracker seems very inaccurate on the S3, but was accurate on the S2. The S3 never shows me as having stress, only as relaxed or calm, which is not the case 😅 Also, the sleep tracker is inaccurate. It shows I was asleep an hour early last night, although I was actively texting / moving around. I'm hopeful there will be some kinda software update to improve these features. Besides those 2 issues, I am pleased with the watch. I only use basic features and it works for me."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Jess Y.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood watch for the price,13-Nov-23,"I think the features of this watch are good for the price. I have a fairly large wrist, so I must wear it at the last hole, but that is an easy fix in the future. The fact that you can use it to find your phone and use the app on your phone to find your watch is awesome. I don't know how accurate the steps and heart bpm are but they give you a good idea of how active you are. If you aren't looking for anything too fancy and overpriced and just want the basics with some customization, this watch is perfect at an affordable price."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Elizabeth,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsBest value smartwatch!!!,7-Sep-23,"The TOZO S3 Smart Watch has been an outstanding addition to my daily life.

Gilder,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSuper value for a good smart watch,16-Oct-23,"I have used this watch for 2 months now and so far it’s worked well! First of all, I am giving this a 5 star review with value being a big factor. For the price compared to other smart watches, this one offers a lot for little $$. It’s a great watch for basic stuff….phone calls, text notifications and health info. Phone calls sound good. Display is sharp and screen size is approx. 1.25"" x 1.25"". However I have already scratched it so I recommend getting a screen protector.The Tozo health app had a few bugs when I first installed it. But the Tozo tech support team was quick to respond to my issue with the app and they released an updated version within a week. I’m using a Samsung S23 and it pairs with the phone well. The battery life seems very longSo far so good. I have no serious complaints about this watch particularly considering the price that I paid. If you are looking for a budget smart watch, this is the one to buy."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWhat I like,25-Oct-23,"Price!  This obviously is not an apple watch, but I wouldn't buy it for my kids.  They're really not going to know better, except they have a watch that looks very similar to mine.  And if they smash it (which they will), I would not flinch.  At the end of the day, this is a good beginner watch to see if you like or will use any of the features.  The OS sensor should also be good to get a measure on a sick kid instead of having to do those thumb devices.  The magnetic charge is a bit odd since it has to fit on exactly right, but the watch charges only at nights.  Good beginner watch."

B07L1GWR66,Watch A,TyDroid,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsHappy with this watch,13-Oct-23,"This is a pretty good smart watch, especially considering the reasonable price. It has a nice large screen with good resolution, not really pixilated. At first I was worried that the band was not sure on the watch and that it may fall off, but after wearing it for a few weeks now, I can see that the band is very secure, which is an important feature to me. I am pleasantly surprised at the battery life as I don't have to charge it very often unless I am keeping it on downloading watch faces or other battery heavy activity. I was able to use the watch the other day to track a hike we went on. It timed my hike and also gave us the distance we hiked. Very cool. Overall, I'm happy with this watch and would recommend it if you like a smart watch with the larger face."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,David Sollinger,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Watch for Value.,27-Sep-23,"Good value for what you get. I had a little difficulty getting the watch to notify me of text messages, but got it figured out after playing with it for a bit. Only feature I wish it had was the ability to reply to messages. You can set quick replies to send, but they dont offer you the ability to type a reply.Overall, very satisfied with my purchase. I was in the market for a smartwatch and think this is almost on par with the top brands."

I’ve done this with my Apple Watch and it hurt as they’re very expensive. Open the package, too big a watch face for my small wrist. Gave it to my son who reports it works just fine for texts, activity tracking and more. The quality is good, made well. Doesn’t feel or look cheap at all. The battery life so far has held up. He doesn’t wear it 24:7 just for hikes and school. Would recommend it to others who want the look and feel of a smartwatch but don’t want to pay and arm and a leg.Tozo makes quality products in my opinion."

When it comes to its design, the band design particularly caught my attention, as the belt neatly tucks under the strap, preventing it from protruding and causing any discomfort. Moreover, the watch is budget-friendly. It boasts all the essential features one would expect from a smartwatch. In general, it proves to be exceptionally useful for tracking daily activities and providing health-related notifications, such as reminders to hydrate and practice good hand hygiene. Thus far, my experience with it has been nothing short of astonishing, and I'm also a satisfied user of their wireless earbuds, both of which offer impressive battery life."

I haven't used it for exercise just yet but it was easy to set up and have already started tracking sleep,  heart rate, reminders to drink water and move around.  I work remotely and hoping this will support healthy habits to get up throughout the day.  So far,  so good. I recommend this watch and for the cost, it's definitely a great purchase!"

B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Emily Sebring,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsLove it but no texts are received.,12-Nov-23,"I ordered this product because my husband tried it out and everything works great on it. Notifications phone calls. However, when I try to get a text message received, I don’t receive text messages on the device. I receive phone calls I receive social media notifications I receive everything except text messages, my husband has the exact same device. He’s had it for maybe a month two months longer than me and he receives text but I got this Thursday. I’ve had it on for five hours and I have received no text messages."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,bruna verly godzikowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis product is a game changer!,27-Sep-23,"I am overall very impressed with a watch at this price range offering so much! I have broken down my thoughts below.*Pros*Bluetooth Calling: Works amazingly, tested with my wife and she could not tell if it was the phone's or watch's mic.Customizable Watch Faces: multiple watch face options, not as extensive as other brands but pretty impressive for a budget modelComprehensive Health Tracking: Monitor heart rate, sleep quality, steps, distance, calories burned, active minutes, and even blood oxygen saturation.Impressive Battery Life: Lasting about 5-7 days with regular use!Waterproof Design: tested and survived under water and shower*Cons*:Limited App Ecosystem: the app ecosystem may not be as extensive as some higher-end smartwatches.Basic Design: The design is functional but might lack the premium aesthetic of more expensive alternatives. However it seems durable.No GPS: Lacks built-in GPS, so it relies on your phone's GPS for location tracking during outdoor activities.Screen: The screen is good and colors are vibrant. However I missed being able to tap to turn off the screen, so at times it keeps on and I just have to wait for it to turn off (it bothers my wife in the middle of the night).Overall highly recommended! I've been following this brand for quite some time now and it's crazy how they make good quality products that are also affordable and the S3 watch is no exception."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Christopher GauChristopher Gau,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat battery life for a smartwatch,4-Oct-23,"First off, these look great from a design standpoint - more sleek and thin, even compared to my girlfriend's Apple Watch SE, which these look to be ripped off of design-wiseFunctionality-wise, I love using the sleep tracker the most. This functions as-designed pretty consistently. However, the same cannot be said of the BPM tracker - sometimes this just doesn't read and gives an error. Also, the feature to find your phone would be amazing if it worked consistently; half of the time, it doesn't do anything. It would be nice that the feature would always sound the alarm, even if your phone was on silent as well (currently it just vibrates the phone weakly if the phone is on silent, which isn't helpful at all).Battery life is stellar - usually lasts me about 5 days or so before needing a quick recharge. Mobile app is sufficient.Compared to the old S2 model, this adds a few new watch faces, as well as the ability to connect to your phone to see messages/calls. Still no ability to play/pause music, which is a bummer as it's something I personally am interested in"

B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Megan,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI like it so far!,19-Sep-23,"I recently purchased this Tozo 3 to upgrade from my Tozo 2 watch. So far I really enjoy all of the additonal features and the new app!  Everything is super easy to setup and I feel like this watch is more elaborative in all aspects compared to the 2. I trust Tizo products and their apps. I have tried other brands before and had to send them back because of the stats being inadequate, or the app wouldn't sync properly.  I did have a few issues with my Tozo 2 watch syncing, but only towards the end right before I replaced it. It was over 3 years old!  The only complaint I have about the Tozo 3 is the screen size. I was expecting it to be a little bigger, but it's almost identical to the size of the Tozo 2. I was under the impression it was supposed to be 1.83 inches.  It's not a deal breaker though. I still love everything it offers for the price I paid. I hope the Tozo 4 screen is bigger, and they add GPS to it. I would definitely pay more for those features being I trust thus company's quality.  I would also love to have more band customization as well, but I'll settle for black if I cam get a bigger screen and GPS!"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Henry T,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsAffordable and Highly Functional!,19-Nov-23,"I was initially skeptical of buying a low-cost watch, but having purchased TOZO products in the past, I decided to buy their new smartwatch. I think that the watch works extremely well for its cost; it does everything that most smartwatches already do, with the exception of viewing text messages. One thing to note is that they have a separate `TOZO Health` app that you will need to download, which is a separate app from the original `TOZO` app."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Chad2thebone,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsDecent watch,26-Oct-23,"Bought this watch with the intent of using it to work out at the gym. After about a week or so of use, I have found that the battery life on the watch is not great. My watch will last after a full charge, around a day and a half and then I have to recharge the battery again. The software operates as good as you think it would, it snappy, and it the screen is responsive. Maybe it's just my watch in particular, as to why the battery is not lasting like all the other reviews say it should last. Anyway I would recommend this if you just need a watch to work out and answer a call here and there."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Amazon CustomerAmazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsNice looking watch that does everything as advertised,22-Sep-23,"Nice watch, very similar to the S2, with the additional cross functionality needed to interact with your phone.  Overall this is a nice upgrade, providing seamless interaction with my iPhone.  Actually surprised that sometimes notifications, texts and calls come to the watch before my phone.  Not sure how that happens, but it does show there is no delay between the two.Overall I am happy with the watch and feel it is an excellent value.Only negative I have is in relation the Battery life.  Not a big deal to charge once a week, but I can easily get a full 2 weeks with my S2.  Not sure if I have a bad battery, or if it is the result of additional battery drain coming from the additional functionality.  A lot of different watch faces you can download is a nice free option."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Eagle Vision,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWorks better than my Fitbit,3-Sep-23,"I have used Fitbit watches for the past decade.  However, I wanted a watch with a bigger and brighter screen.  Fitbits are known for their excellent battery life and an Apple watch is known for the opposite.Watch faces:First, I like watch faces that show information such as battery life, time, date,  calories, steps and pulse all in the same screen.  The process to change faces is very easy in this system.  Additionally, I don't have to contend with purchasing watch face systems, like the Fitbit does.  I do wish there was  a way to configure the faces to allow what I want to have for choices since it has 5 defaults that cannot be removed.Battery life:This shines in the battery life department.  With light exercise and use it easily lasts 6 days.  With heavy exercise, occasional talking and frequent screen access, battery life is about 3 days.Functions:Pulse detection is great.  It also allows monitoring for stress level, oxygen level, sleep, and activities.The companion app syncs quickly and is very responsive.Miscellaneous functions:Stopwatch, Timer, Alarm and World clock.  I actually use this as my alarm clock to wake up.  It has been reliable for me.Flashlight function.  It takes 3 clicks and I don't find it to be my top priority given the multiple steps to turn it on.Weather.  It works fine but the units stay in metric.  I cannot figure out how to toggle that function.OverallOverall, the function is great.  The price value exceeds expectations for a watch with these functions."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Tanner M SmithTanner M Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsNice quality, some quirks, but great inexpensive alternative to track steps.",27-Sep-23,"The watch comes in elegant packaging, with one long band. The charging is relatively fast and the battery life is quite impressive. The crown does not scroll, which it should. The watch is great quality considering the price point. It looks great on the wrist and although not as extensive as with the Apple watch, the face gallery offers a fair selection of styles and colors to suit your individual tastes.I tried wearing the watch for tennis (I usually use an Apple watch 7), yet I was unimpressed with its tracking. Within 15 minutes it had buzzed stating I covered 3km...which is, of course, impossible.I think this watch is best suited for those who need it for sleep monitoring, counting steps, and perhaps simpler exercises like running/walking. At this price point, you couldn't find a better option."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,JK,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat watch,29-Sep-23,"My fitbit charge died so I decided to try this instead of spending all that $$ on a new fitbit.  It does everything my fitbit did and more!  It keeps an accurate reading of my heart rate when I work out on my elliptical which was important to me ( I compare  the heart rate to the machine monitor ) .  I like the oxygen sensor especially in these times of covid returning.  Of course it does the standard date/time/weather.  It can actually answer calls whereas my fitbit only showed who was calling.  You can see texts and emails.  I wouldn't wear it in the pool, which is what killed my fitbit after the company told me it was ok to wear it swimming . It has alot of features some might like such as telling you how much water to drink, when to move etc. It can store 6 exercises and you can change them around on the app, which I really like. It's so convenient to not have to stop what you're doing to see a text or phone call...just a glance is all it takes."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,BBBB,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat for a $40 smart watch,11-Oct-23,"I like the battery life and value of the wearable computer. it can connect to iPhones and receive text/call/app. I also appreciate the HR & sleep monitoring.I had apple smart watch before this. It turns out finding repair people for a smart watch is hard. For the replacement, I got this one. For the prices it works pretty well for basic functionality, I've been using this one for almost 3 weeks now. Most apps work fine. It has a find your phone function, which I was super excited about. It tells me the time, tracks my steps and the battery life is INSANE!!! My record so far is almost 7 days, then you charge it for about 2 hours and it lasts another 9 or 10. I don't even turn it off at night, so compared to the other watch with a 3 day lifespan and turning it off every night, I'm certainly very happy."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,snookums,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat smartwatch!,14-Nov-23,"Display, battery life, and features are all pretty nice on the s3, especially for the price. Setup is quick and painless, the face/case have a nice finish, and the size seems compatible with a wide range of wrists. I don't use the fitness aspects of the watch, so I can't comment on those, but everything else is pretty sweet. I like the Find My Watch feature in the phone app, but wish there were a Find My Phone feature from the watch side, as well. Maybe in a future update?"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,David Sunfellow,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI Like It Better Than My Apple Watch!,5-Oct-23,"The headline says it all: I replaced my Apple Watch with this watch. It can't do everything an Apple Watch can do, but it can do all the main things I need it to: Tell the time, track my steps, show me when text messages arrive, see and answer incoming calls, track sleep cycles, track heart rates, provide weather reports, even find my iPhone if I misplace it! For $40.00, this is as close to a perfect purchase as you can get. It's not perfect, of course. It can't compete head-to-head with Apple's $250.00 plus watches. It also has a couple of issues that need improvement: the built in speaker sucks (it is very hard to hear and talk to anyone after you answer a call on it), and I couldn't find a way to use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit in the weather app. I'm still giving it 5 stars to thank TOZO for making a remarkable watch at an affordable price. Thank you. Well done."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Aaron M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsReally good product,10-Nov-23,"Received this product in a timely manner. This is for my husband as he does not have an iphone. He likes it very much. It does not do GPS and you can not answer a text message with it, but you can read the text message. Battery life is very good on it. Would recommend this if you do not want to have advanced features and just want it to do basic things."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,A,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsGreat watch, especially for the price.",29-Oct-23,"This watch is on par with much more expensive smart watches. The only things I would recommend to change would be when you dismiss a notification on the phone, it still stays on the watch, and also can only send quick replies, not full keyboard for SMS.Sound quality on a call was actually better than my Samsung Watch 4.This watch also works on iOS and Android, so that's a plus as wellOverall I like the watch, and would recommend for someone looking for a good budget priced smartwatch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,SamSam,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsHelpful Health Watch,14-Nov-23,"The app isn't great, but gets the job done for the most part. Battery's been holding up for a couple days at a time, but doesn't have a few features I was hoping to see from a smart watch (no responding to messages sans pre-filled quick texts, sleep function leaves much to be desired), but overall solid build quality and a good device for the price."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,MMMM,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Entry Level Smart / Fit Watch,28-Aug-23,"There's a ton of fit and smartwatches out there to choose from. And to be honest I only chose this one because I have Bluetooth earbuds by the same brand. This was a pretty good purchase in my opinion.To start with the health monitoring features, for me they're just okay. I have dark skin and I don't know how much that plays into it but getting it to read blood / oxygen and sleep is very hit and miss for me. The heart monitoring and stress monitors seem to be a bit more consistent but I can only assume that they're at least ball park accurate. Nice little features but not something I heavily rely on.I do like the notifications and the ability to take calls from the watch face. There are some apps that won't allow push notifications but I haven't found many.Some of the other features are nice plusses like when you raise your hand the face will turn on conserving battery when you're not using it.At the end of the day, this is a nice little watch for a good price that does cool things. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who isnt relying on it being super sensitive to health monitoring and just wants a cool starter smartwatch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Gunner1st,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsNot a Bad Smart Watch!,12-Nov-23,"It works well and has some automated features that make it nice, one particularly is the automatic sensing of exercise and counting it.  It isn't showing notifications coming through on the phone which is annoying though I suspect an update my well address it.  It's a good size and pretty easy to see with many different faces to choose from."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,P Dover,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsVery comfortable!,16-Nov-23,"The TOZO S3 Smart Watch represents a significant improvement over the last generation. It is very comfortable, charges reasonably quickly, and can last the entire day without needing to be charged until night. However, the heart and sleep tracking features are a bit lacking, as they are not terribly accurate. Overall, I'm happy to use this watch on a daily basis."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Jlarge,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSolid watch for money long battery life,12-Nov-23,"So I am writing this after several weeks of use but I have been impressed. Can change dial faces, keeps fairly accurate readings of HB, sleep and steps for 1/10 the price of the Apple/Google watches. I charged 2 weeks ago today and still have 25% left on battery. Won't sing too loud or long and see how it does with some history but so far so good."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Yatsen Joa Castillo,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsAbove & Beyond Expectations!,21-Oct-23,"Exceeded my expectations! Battery life is nearly perfect, meaning that my used it for a whole month without charging and it was 28%, has never been under 28% no matter how much is used and how expensive it is. Touchscreen is perfectly sensitive, fast and smooth performance. 100% recommended, I personally believe that with this watch we (my family and even friends) do not need some fruit-branded/expensive watch."
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Daniel P. Gerber,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsUpgraded Features - Especially the calling features!,20-Aug-23,"The media could not be loaded.                 Here are my thoughts on latest iteration of the TOZO line of blue tooth/fitness tracker and now added calling features...  There is a lot packed into this device at an incredible price.  The app that you download for either your iPhone or android device interfaces very easily.  Connecting via Bluetooth with very little complication to connect it.Out of the box as my video indicated the packaging has been streamlined.  So, the watch comes detached from the watch band, with simple instructions on how to attach the bands to the watch.  For those like me with big hands it will take a little effort - but within a few minutes the bands will be on.After following the directions provided, I was able to test the watch out via the phone and the sound and connectivity was perfect.  The app allows you to import address books and do things such as have quick replies for text messaging.I found the product feature rich with all the monitoring tools including the body functioning elements and also things like tracking weather.  I continue to dig into the device and find it loaded with features.The fitness part of it offers a wide range of activities you can monitor those activities.  Which I found incredible.  As my video indicated I was kind of confused in the fact that swimming was left out - in consideration it is waterproof.  I may be missing something in this assumption and that the S2 had that as part of the fitness tracking.  I have sent some messages to TOZO to get clarification on that piece and hope to get some input.That is not a deal breaker given the price point and the abilities of this device.  It is clear TOZO is very motivated to keep building on their existing line.  The tech you receive at the price point they offer it at is simply great.  I definitely recommend if you are not looking to break the bank in getting into a smart watch to help you monitor your fitness and provide great way to communicate safely while doing it!"

Este reloj se destaca por su esfera más amplia y cómoda, lo que añade un toque de comodidad a su uso diario. Además, disfruto plenamente de sus múltiples funcionalidades, incluyendo la capacidad de leer mensajes y recibir llamadas, las cuales fueron las principales motivaciones que me llevaron a realizar la compra.Con una experiencia previa en productos Tozo que siempre ha destacado por su excelente relación calidad-precio, no me sorprendió que la entrega de este dispositivo fuera igualmente eficiente y sin complicaciones.El proceso de emparejamiento con mi dispositivo móvil fue rápido y sin complicaciones, y el reloj se ajusta cómodamente a mi muñeca. Su funcionalidad y calidad de pantalla son notables, con características como el seguimiento del sueño, la monitorización de la frecuencia cardíaca y el registro de los pasos, todos aspectos cruciales para mí. Además, la capacidad de recibir llamadas telefónicas directamente desde el reloj es una ventaja que valoro enormemente.La duración de la batería, que puede llegar a una semana con una sola carga, me satisface plenamente. En resumen, estoy más que satisfecho con el Tozo S3, especialmente considerando su precio asequible, y no dudaría en recomendarlo como una elección inteligente para aquellos que buscan un reloj inteligente económico pero completo. Mi experiencia de un mes ha sido extremadamente positiva, y en general, estoy muy contento con mi compra, por lo que lo recomiendo con confianza a quienes buscan una opción asequible en el mundo de los relojes inteligentes."

It has so many features at suuuuuch an excellent price. It can connect to messenger apps but not texts itself-- that's the only piece it's missing to me.

I bought it for only one reason, it has a music feature to play/pause/ff songs on my music app I use while morning walk. There is a built-in (loud) speaker that helps to find it (vibration and/or ringtone) if misplaced which I do often. I wish the speaker would play music on it. The dial is big and looks neat.

It is great, has good battery life, good mic for phone calls, and tracks everything well. The only problem i have is not being able to get it on thr 12 hour clock instead of it being on the 24 hour clock how it comes. Other than that I'm completely satisfied with the product especially the band cuz it tucks underneath and I have little wrist so my other one would flap but this one doesn't and it is so awesome"
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Vicky g,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsPretty great,8-Oct-23,It's pretty unbelievable how tozo was able to produce and sell this for what they are. Looks nice.  Works great.  Built in speaker and mic I've had to complaints on calls. Watch also vibrates for morning alarms to not wake your spouse.  Tracking seems to work well.  Notifications come through well. Can't respond from the watch but honestly that's not a feature i wanted.  This thing was absolutely perfect for what i was looking for. App has good features and is easy to use. Bluetooth pairing with my galaxy s20 was easy and haven't had any drops. Battery lasts several days. I caught a sale for $30 but this thing is worth closer to 100 than 30. Well done tozo!
B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Miyun Yun,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsA Great Budget Smart Watch,8-Sep-23,"This watch is incredible for the price! I have used the Tozo S2 previously and have noticed a lot of improvements in the S3. It has some of the same features (heart rate, sleep tracker, etc.) but also has new features like making and receiving calls. The app is incredibly easy to use and I haven’t had any issues with it personally. I have also found the fitness tracking elements to be pretty accurate.I was concerned at first with the size of the watch face, but it being bigger has been super beneficial and I don’t struggle to read the screen at all. It was a bit difficult to connect the straps but once I attached them, they haven’t budged and it has been very comfortable.The battery is also wonderful and lasted about 5 days before I had to charge it. I am really enjoying this so far and definitely thing it is a good dupe for a lot of more expensive smart watches."

I prefer it to my Fitbit Sense.,9-Oct-23,"My Fitbit Sense died a few months after the 1-year warranty so I looked for a replacement and found this watch.It does everything I used my fitbit for, but for 15% of the price. I mainly wanted something to tell time, count my steps, and send messages from my phone to my wrist and it does these functions very well. The only thing it doesn't do is allow quick message replies to messages - that function only works for incoming phone calls. I also wish there were more band options available. But those downsides are hardly downsides. I'm shocked they can sell such a well-made smart watch at this cost and still make a profit."

Step and activity tracking, including heart rate monitoring were very accurate. App doesn't have cumulative count of activity for steps or exercise time for the week or month. Hopefully this will be added in the future."

Battery life is extremely good, even with heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking enabled.  You can answer phone calls and talk on the watch - sound quality is good.The only problem I have had is the screen likes to change watch faces on me randomly.  Its like there is something touching the screen when there isn't, and if you do that it goes to the watch face changing screen.Overall, great watch for cheap!"

Insane battery life (8 days and still going for my use),16-Oct-23,"First of all, as an apple watch user, the battery life is utterly ridiculous. I'm 7-8 days in, and I still got juice. This is pretty crazy.I like that you can ping your phone (another big feature I like in my apple watch).I get notifications just as well. Can't respond, but not a big deal.The one thing I miss is the lack of GPS - need my phone around to track a workout such as a run, which is less than ideal.Otherwise, amazing price for what you get.

B07L1GWR66,Watch A,William,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis is a great smart watch!!!,19-Oct-23,"I really like this watch. It's easy to use and is great for tracking my workouts. One of my favorite features is the ability to answer my phone directly from the watch. When I'm exercising or working with my hands, it's very convenient not to have to take my phone out of my pocket to answer it. I would suggest this to anyone that is looking for a smart watch at a good price."

B07L1GWR66,Watch A,Jae Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat for keeping up with your health,21-Sep-23,Sadly I had to change my review because the watch died on me. I guess it isn’t water proof as it is supposed to be. The touch screen quit functioning after a week of use.  I ordered a replacement hopefully it was just the one watch that was defective.So the replacement came about a week ago. I r had to reboot it 3 times due to the touch screen not responding. I was excited to find a smart watch at this price but I’m just going to go head and get an Apple Watch bc this one doesn’t work how it should and it hasn’t been worth the hassle and frustration.
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,jackflovejackflove,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsThe Best of the Last Four Watches I have Tried,5-Jun-23,"I've been looking for the perfect ""smart watch"" for about a year now, and I've sampled four different brands, two watches within one of those brands. This one makes the grade, and it's the one I'll be using for the foreseeable future. Apparently the name of the watch and model is ""Tank M2"" although as with other imports, if there is a real brand name, it's a mystery. The box just says ""Smart Watch."" I found ""Tank M2"" on the enclosed User Manual.Some of what I am about to say is based on other comments I've read here, and I will lead with the most important one for me. I actually purchased this watch because of the claim of long battery life, and so far it is living up to that promise. After 3 days of pretty hard use, the battery is still at 87%, which suggests it will last the two weeks promised. One reason my experience may be better than others is that I don't use Bluetooth, don't see any reason to use the watch as my phone, and also disabled the feature that turns the watch on if one raises their arm. I know from my experience with other watches that that feature burns  a lot of battery, and I don't mind pressing the button when I want to see the time.Several people have commented on the available dial faces and I have to say that I agree that the overwhelming majority of these dials seem to be childish and useless. But all that matters in my opinion is that there are a few dials that serve the purpose, and as you can see in the photo, I'm perfectly happy with this one.Now for the nitty-gritty on features: the sleep tracker is superb, best one I've found. I can't comment on Blood Oxygen because I have no way to know whether that's accurate, I guess I hope it is because it's giving me a good result. Several people have complained about the Blood Pressure measurement, here I have to strongly disagree and say that this is the best watch for measuring BP I have found. I have a medical cuff, so I can compare results. Of course they are not identical--for that matter, I get different results on my cuff from the one my physician uses. The watch is within 10 points of the cuff on both systolic and diastolic. But that's all missing the point. No one should be relying on these sorts of devices for Blood Pressure other than one important thing: if the watch reports that you are having high or low BP, that's an indication you should get a check up. That's what matters.Of course these watches were designed to count steps, and the step counter on this watch seems to be extremely accurate. There's very little lag time between starting to walk and the watch starting to count those steps.This brings me to the one issue I have had, and the reason I'm withholding one star from my review. For some reason, the watch uses a standard of 4000 steps to a mile. Not only is this wrong according to my other four watches, it's wrong by a course I've mapped out using my car's odometer. According to all four watches, a mile for me is between 2300 and 2500 steps, and according to the one-mile marked course, I need 2325 steps for that mile. I have contacted the company's technical service department, but so far all they've done is offer me an extra watch strap for my inconvenience. I'm happy to accept the strap, but I'd also like to have a more accurate distance measure. Wags like to recite ""your mileage may vary"", but here the problem seems to be that the mileage isn't varying--it's stuck on 4000!The watch does seem to be built like a tank, I have no worries about its durability and water safety. For now at least, this is the watch I'll be wearing every day, and compared with the other four watches I have tried, I'm willing to say it is also the best ""bang for the buck."""
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Cassandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat customer service,9-Nov-23,"Update to original post: As I originally stated,  my husband LOVED this watch. He was ""playing"" with it constantly for the first week he had it. He appreciated and enjoyed all of its functions, especially that it was waterproof so he could control his music playing on our speakers while in the pool! Anyway, the company saw my review, contacted me immediately and apologized that I was given the run around. They worked with me to make it right! Awesome customer service,  I think my initial experience trying to contact someone was not the usual. Get the watch, you'll love it.I ordered this watch for my husband fir father's day June 2023. He loved it and it's functionality.  After having it for approximately 2 months, the app offered an update. He updated and the screen went haywire and we messed with it for a few days, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, letting the battery run all the way out and fully charging.  Couldn't get it to work again. I call Amazon and they are ""too bad, it's just past 60 days, you should have sent it back sooner""  We'll it JUST STOPPED WORKING.  Why would I send it back at 60 days when it was still working fine at that point? So, they tell me they will take it back with a fee, so I would only get about $60 back. I told them that I wanted it replaced, isn't there a warranty? They tell me to contact the manufacturer.  Fine. Try to find contact info for the company and it's just a physical address.  Ugh. My husband does some research and finally reaches them only to be told that we need to contact Amazon to return it!!!"
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,rgbatduke,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsNot worth it.,18-Oct-22,"I got this watch for two reasons.  I already had a garmin vivosmart 4, which does super-well at SPO2 monitoring in your sleep (mail reason I got it) and remarkably well at activity tracking etc.  It also had a very good android app interface for quickly viewing graphs of its running observations and more.  Its flaws were a watch band that is too short and not adjustable, charge that only lasts for 4-5 days tops, and it ONLY does heart rate and SPO2 for health monitoring.So, I got the AMAZTIM, in order to get a much longer runtime per charge and its blood pressure monitoring as WELL as SPO2 and heart rate.  It is also a much -- much! -- bigger watch than the vivosmart so I thought its interface might be a bit better and access to more advanced smartwatch features better as well.I was mightily disappointed.  The ONLY part of its hype this watch lives up to is its run time per charge, which is easily more than a week, almost two weeks.  What doesn't is:  a) Watch faces that look like they were designed and intended for teen-age adolescents who like cartoon animals.  Seriously?  Not one, single, watch face that actually uses the vast real estate of this large watch for something other than cartoons, fancy backgrounds, science-fiction spreads?  Nothing that (for example) displays time/date/heart rate/SPO2/steps/BP?  There's plenty of room for all of this...but instead we get cartoon beaches with only the time.  b) The Blood Pressure it measures is completely useless.  I mean, off by 20-30 points useless, when compared to BP taken by actual cuffs by actual nurses or physicians.  20-30 points low useless -- I'm healthy as a horse according to the watch, 106/66.  Only not -- PROBABLY more like 126/80 -- if not higher (which is the problem).  c) Heart rate is not too accurate either.  I tend to run slow, but it thinks that I'm up at 82 after sitting completely still for over an hour.  d) SPO2 almost always reads 99%.  I do have an oximeter to compare to, and it reads more like 96-96% where the Garmin reads 94-95%.  I trust the Garmin to be consistently low, because if I e.g. hold my breath to drop SPO2, it remains a couple of percent under.  I'm not sure I trust the always 99% reading.  Again, great if true, but almost too good.But the worst of all is the Da Fit app.  It isn't even in the same UNIVERSE as the Garmin Connect app.  Garmin plots data on an actual graph with time as an actual axis.  You can see how your heart rate changes over the entire day, as it constantly samples it.  It doesn't CONSTANTLY sample SPO2 -- I wish -- but it DOES sample it for a selected four hour window while you sleep, making it actually amazingly useful for determining whether or not you have Sleep Apnea when your wife (the physican) thinks EVERYBODY my age has it -- but the Garmin says that I do not.  Just sayin', worth it right there.  Cheaper and easier and I'll bet just as effective as a sleep study, and it runs EVERY NIGHT (one reason the Garmin runs out of charge in five days).The AMAZFIT only samples SPO2 when you, by hand, tell it two -- scroll four screens, press a button, wait.  It doesn't automatically sample at night or regularly in some window.  It only samples heart rate when you tell it to -- well, it actually does sample it all of the time but doesn't send the data back to the app and display it as a function of TIME.  BP is shown only ""for the last seven times"", but it doesn't actually LABEL them with the TIME or DATE you took them.  Ditto SPO2 -- last seven times you hand measured it, without any sort of timestamp, in a BAR CHART not even a graph.Look, almost anybody's smart watch will track steps, stairs, hikes, etc -- fitness training is easy if rarely completely accurate as they rely on things like accelerometer reading a lot more than they rely on sampling your GPS coordinates.  The key health metrics they can currently reach are heart rate (a very few more than just ""rate""!), SPO2 (enormously useful if it will run overnight), and blood pressure.  Except that so far, BP just doesn't seem to work, and EEG-quality heart results are still only on very expensive watches, and NONE of these are worth much if you can't SEE HOW THEY VERY WITH STRESS AND TIME ON A REAL GRAPH.I suppose it is back to the drawing board.  It's very difficult to get a clear and unbiased review of what is out there.  I'm tempted by an EEG-capable watch, but that is super limited right now.  I'd love accurate -- note accurate, within say 5 torr -- BP, SPO2 (within 2%, consistently one war or the other around oximeter readings), heart rate -- all displayed in real graphs with time axes of a reasonably small granularity -- once a minute, say, or once every fifteen seconds depending on what one is looking at.  WITH week plus runtime per charge.  And sure, with activity/sports stuff too, but that's a dime a dozen and easy."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,ALH,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsVery impressive!,11-Nov-23,"I was about to order another Samsung Gear 3 Smartwatch, because the phone wouldn't sustain a charge after 3 years of use. The M2 Smartwatch came up in my research prior to hitting the buy button on the  S S3--and it was less expensive. Short-story, I ordered the M2. Of course, Amazon came through on the deliver of the M2 the same day! Now, that I have the M2 on my wrist OMG very impressive! The M2 has all the same function as some of the popular expensive smartwatches (I have had 2 SG3s, and I still have the Apple 6 watch).  I wanted another Smartwatch that I could wear all day that would sustain a charge while at work (12-14 hour shifts). I will place this smartwatch right up there with the prior smartwatches I have purchased! My M2 review is based on the short time I have had the M2, I will update this review if concerns arise.  The AMAZTIM just won a new customer!"
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Bob Stapleton,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsSo far so good.,24-Oct-23,"So far so good. There is no way this thing will ever last 60 days. I’m getting about 5 1/2- 6 days out of the battery. I charged the watch fully and went on a 11 day trip and left the charger at home. The watch was dead before the end of the 6th day.It’s a pretty decent watch, big display, easy to read and has all the functions I was looking for in a smart watch, but the battery will not last very long.The other thing I don’t like, is when you look at the app on your phone, you always have to wait 10-15 seconds for the watch to connect to the app, it doesn’t stay connected the whole time."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Jaspec,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsExploding watchband- REMEDIED,24-Oct-23,"The company replaced the watchband & now I'm much more satisfied with the product. The non-watchband related quirks however remain.I'm liking the features & notifs so far,for my life style this rugged budget friendly watch seems excellent...but the ruggedness is called into question when I have the band break filling orders day one, I'm certain it'll fly apart again when it's time to shake cocktails :(It thinks I'm asleep watching TV so it's not spot on thereIt also treats rolling in bed as steps, so, I rolled 400 steps apparentlySometimes call audio routes to the watch despite it having no speakers, turn off your Bluetooth before accepting any calls to get around this."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,John E McBride,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat overall,3-Nov-23,"I bought this to replace a dying smartwatch. This watch was easy to setup, use, and charge. I was able to buy quick change bands to make it more interesting to wear. The watch shows health results and the app gives greater details. Warning: May cause false readings if worn during EKG test. I wore this during an EKG and the test showed Atrial-Fibrilation. Further tests are showing no A-Fib without watch."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Patricia,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsBasic decent smartwatch but don't expect accurate BP readings,4-Jan-23,"I purchased a AMAZTIM 5ATM for my husband primarily to help him keep track of his blood pressure and after researching several smartwatches I decided to go with the AMAZTIM 5ATM.The trouble is I am whatever the opposite of a tech person is and my husband is about as techie as you can be. While he very much appreciated the thought, he immediately knew that neither this smartwatch, nor any other smartwatch, was at all accurate when it came to blood pressure. But he strapped it on and like any other tech person started through all of the options and functions.Naturally, it told the time so we can skip that. What I got from him was the heart rate and O2 were very much in line with a store-bought pulse-oximeter and therefore, as far as he was concerned, reliable and useful.There were a few things that bothered him but I am much more of a positive person so let’s start with the good points. I already mention pulse rate and O2. That seems first rate. Battery life is excellent. Three days and it’s still at 80%. The charger cable, while not the usual mini-USB, connects magnetically. I’m guessing that’s to avoid a slot that water can get into. It’s a nice feature. The watch paired with his iPhone very easily.On the downs-side blood pressure reading were very off but he knew that even if I didn’t and I don’t count it against the product.My husband gets text messages and other app notifications frequently and since he keeps his phone on silent mode and in his pocket, he sometimes misses them. Getting those notifications from the watch sounded like a good deal and he set everything up on the watch and companion phone app, DA Fit, I think it is. He got very frustrated because hardly any notifications from any app came through to the watch. Not zero notifications which would mean it didn’t work at all, but some, which for a very impatient person like himself frustrated him more since he tried to figure it out. He did not figure it out.The weather function, while he didn’t really care about, said it wasn’t paired, which he didn’t know what that meant (the teeny instruction booklet wasn’t helpful), but it did work... once. Again, Mr Frustration cared more about why it worked once than not at all.My husband is an avid cyclist (he’s on his bike more than he’s home sometimes). The Sport Mode, which was supposed to be a long press on the second button, never worked at all.Three categories that really didn’t work is problematic.I did contact the seller and got a prompt next day reply from, I’m assuming, a different time zone. They offered to remediate the issue but unbeknownst to me he sent it back - sigh. I would have given them a chance. Men, right?Bottom line: don’t get any smartwatch for blood pressure and this product in particular has definite shortcomings. The watch itself gets 3 stars but I added a star for the seller who tried to make it right even if my husband didn’t wait."

Everyone has their own opinions on things, right.  I bought this watch August 21, 2023.  For me this is a great watch for the features that it has and the price.  Durability is great, it is very light, sometimes I forget it is on my hand. Easy set up for the app. I just wanted to comment on the battry life though, it last long. Initial charge i estimated approximately two weeks, after that the battery was good.  October 6, 2023 the battery has been charged at 100%, today is October 20, 2023 and the battery is at 41%.  I will definitely say great watch overall.  If you do not use some of the featured items on the watch just turn them off and save more on battery life."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Amzn Geek,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsReally nice looking watch,12-Oct-23,"I like the watch - it looks very nice and pretty fancy. It's larger than some of my previous watches, but I like this since my older eyes had trouble reading the display on previoys watches.  I do think it is very overpriced  at $100.  I got it onb sale and would not have left a 5 star revirew if I paid the full $100.  I've bought smart watches that were equally good for half that.  OF course I don't expect it to be as good as a Samsung or Apple Watch - that's a much higher price point.  But it's good enough for the average user.  A real athlete or someone training should probably opt for something that has more refined sensors."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,David Williams,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsOverall good watch, but has some issues",10-Sep-22,"Original review is below.  I had to downgrade my review because one of the two watches keeps shifting to a ""loading"" display and locks up there.  We have to reboot the watch to get it functioning again, but the problem just comes back after a couple of days.  I have attempted to contact the vendor, and have left messages on their website, but they just don't respond.I can no longer recommend this product if they cannot back it with even rudimentary support.----------Overall, I like this watch.  Every other tracker watch I have owned has been junked for the same reason:  the proprietary band broke, and would cost almost half the price of a new watch to replace.  Not so with this watch.  It has a standard watch band, so you can replace it with just about any standard watch band at a normal band price.The screen is easy to see, and the controls work well.  I have had no complaints with the function, use, or asthenics.  The battery life is great.  I can wear the watch for a week, and only dip down to 40% remaining.The only issue I have with the watch is with data syncing to the app, especially sleep data.  There is no method of initiating a sync manually.  When I wake in the morning, the watch shows my overall sleep hours, but the app is at 0 for the day.  Hours later, is will still say 0, even though other data is updated.  My sleep data will not show up in the app until sometime in the evening.  On a couple of occasions, I was not able to view my sleep breakdown until the following morning.The blood pressure is also not very accurate, and sometimes wildly inaccurate. But that is more an issue with the tech available.  No watch I have used (including the ""high end"" expensive brands) has been accurate for blood pressure.  The pressure cuff is the only reliable measurement available.  So nothing against the watch here, just don't rely on the BP readings if that is an important measurement for you."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Retired PCFixer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsSome good, some not so good!",10-Oct-22,"Watch arrived when promised. Looks good quality construction, heavy duty, rugged. I didn't buy it for it's good looks! A bit larger than I'd anticipated, would not work on small or delicate wrists. Nice long silicone strap with plenty of holes for the buckle. I've had it a week, it has good & bad qualities.Pros:*Nice little levers on the strap to assist in attaching it to the watch, also looks like a standard strap would fit*AWESOME battery life, still at 74% after a week*Nice clear watch face, can program ""shake to display"" & program how long it stays on*Once you get the hang of it, easy to scroll through the various screens* once set up, easy to continuously have heart rate displayed (the main reason I got the watch)*brightness of display can be adjusted. Still can't see it in direct sunlight, but angled away from the sun on a bright day it's still visibleCons:Only 2 analog watch faces available, neither of which is the one shown on the Amazon page. I've Emailed Amaztim about this, still waiting for a reply*Notifications are an almost inaudible buzz, no vibration*Cannot get the BP & SpO2 readings to work, they just show zero. Not an issue for me, blood oxygen unimportant, & blood pressure with anything other than a sphygmometer are notoriously inaccurate*Pedometer function reads about 80% more than actual # of steps & distance. 50 paces registers 86, a measured mile shows 1.87. But it's consistent, whether I do it with hands in pockets or swinging my arms as I walk, so, knowing the error, it's still a useful measurement*Smaller issues, battery life only displays on the app, ""shake to display"" inconsistent, sometimes illuminates with the smallest of arm movements, other times needs a good shake to wake it up.So, in conclusion, in spite of some shortcomings, it's still a good watch, well worth the price.Update: I've ""found extra watch face options, including the one showing in the ad! You can change watch faces directly on the phone itself, but also in the app, which has more options."

It seemed to cover all the bases and was way less than a fitbit with nearly comparable features. This does so much more than I expected, was easy to set up and has a great battery life. My only complaint is that you can't add additional 3rd party apps to get notifications like outlook but it's a small con.*Update... it does allow 3rd party, I had to adjust some settings to get access to those areas but now I get all the notifications I want."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Michael Toia,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsSo far …So good,3-Jul-23,"I received the watch about three days ago and I’m beginning to feel comfortable with it’s features. I have verified everything is operable. I don’t know as yet if the BP, oximeter and pulse are accurate so I will reserve my my assessment after I’ve had time to correlate the results. The one negative at this point is the instructions. Happens all the time.  They design a nice product and then go the cheapest route possible on instructions. Too small of print and written in Chinglish. They at least should have linked a website or some videos. But not to dwell…it a pretty good watch for the price. The phone handoff on Bluetooth work well."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,CJKearns,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood watch at this price point,17-Aug-23,"This smart watch is good at this price point. Although it’s a little bigger than other smart watches I have owned, it has a lot of features I haven’t seen before. One of the biggest features is that the GPS is pretty accurate and syncs to towers quickly. This is an important feat for those who rely on GPS for workouts. In addition, the steps counter is pretty accurate as well (I find that it’s hard for any smart watch to be 100% accurate). It was quick and easy to set up with the app and syncs with the app quickly. Here are other features I found impressive:- A ton exercise options and sports recognition- Accurate and consistent weather- Ability to a sync contacts and answer phone calls- Displays text and phone notifications- Accurate heart rate and blood oxygen level- Flashlight- Music- The ability to connect your phone’s camera to the watch and command the watch to take the picture (handy if you have your phone propped somewhere to take a group photo)- Find my phone- Touchscreen- Large clock faceI noticed that the watch still receives notifications when my iPhone is on do not disturb mode. For some people this isn’t an issue, but it’s worth noting. Overall, this smart watch has a lot of features at a great price point."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsCustomer service,19-Oct-23,I had a cracked lens appear 2 months after purchasing a watch.  I contacted Amaztim directly as it was past Amazons warranty.  I supplied them with documentation to which they were immediately responsive and took care of the problem.  Many companies make it impossible with delays and hurdles to get help.  Totally satisfied customer!!!
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Jay Robbins,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars**UPDATE # 2**,21-Aug-23,"After leaving my 1st updated review I was promptly contacted by the customer service and they offered a full replacement for the watch. I accepted and relayed that I would amend my review based on their making the situation right. I do like the watch and what it offers. I am glad a replacement is in the works.** Old Post** Ok so here we are some 45 days later. The watch was fickle and unreliable. It constantly disconnected and would not restart when rebooted. The only way it would restart was to leave it on the charger for a few hours. Finally it stopped reading steps, BP, oxygen nada. Contacted the vendor because I was 15 days past the return window and the gave me a Gmail address to contact. So the take home point...if you have a 100 dollars to waste this is your ticket. **Original**Out of the box I found this watch to be accurate and beefy as heck. Easy to set up and good battery life so far. Nice selection of faces but that is not really that important to me. Overall a great value for the price. The only negative is that the alarm is not silent. Will update after I put it through it's paces."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Jeff M,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsI have been happy.  Also you can reset if screen freezes,28-Jan-23,"The biometrics are fairly accurate.  The pulse measure seems to work best with the watch rotated over the arteries under of the wrist.Blood pressure and the rest of the readings seem to work perfectly fine with the watch on the top of the wrist.  I have checked blood pressure against my doctors office and have been within several numbers of there readings.  The blood oxygen is within a percent of the doctors office.  The physical activity tracking works very well.The only negative possibly about the watch is you can’t send texts or make telephone calls through it as you can with some much more expensive similar products.  Now to fix a problem I have ran into probably four times since I’ve owned the watch this is screen, freeze wear the watch face will not respond to your finger swipes.  This can be fixed by repeatedly, pushing the power and then the back buttons repeatedly in fast succession for probably 150 reps.  Eventually, the screen will turn off and restart and the watch will work properly at this point.  It has been a good watch. I would recommend it, and I would buy another."

We have HR chest straps that work great but are extra steps in an already dreaded process. He wasn't very impressed with my Amazfit Bip because the HR readings would vary wildly to take seriously. For the Tank 2, we used the HR app and an Omron 10 BP machine to take his pulse simultaneously and found the reading to be accurate enough."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,DaveDave,2.0 out of 5 stars2.0 out of 5 stars,"2.0 out of 5 starsNot a ""smart"" watch, and probably not what you are looking for.",26-Mar-23,"5 things I want in a smartwatch, ranked in priority.1. It has to keep an accurate calorie consumption count.2. It has to have accurate blood pressure.3. It has to pair well with your phone.4. It has to read and write to Apple Health (For my purposes)5. it needs to be easy to use.Everything else really is of little value to me. I don't care how many steps I take in a day. I don't care what my heart rate is. I don't care what my SpO2 values are, or how much, or what kind of sleep I get. All of that is extraneous to my purposes, but if it works, that's fine too. I just don't need it.As you can see from the picture, I worked out for 2and 3/4 hours, and according to this watch, I burned 120 calories. On this particular day, my BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) was 1805. That means that my body is going to burn1805 calories just for my heart to beat, my lungs to breathe, my brain, kidneys, liver, and vital organs to function, while the rest of me is completely dormant. That means that in 2 and 3/4 of an hour just to live, I will burn 206.822917 calories. Yet this gem of a watch says I burned 120 calories. I must be dead. All of these figures are KCal, so this isn't an apples to oranges comparison. By contrast, I also wore a fitbit, which accurately tracks my caloric consumption. My fitbit recorded 451 calories burned, which is much more believable to me.Why it's importantIf you don't know how many calories you are burning, you can't know how many calories to consume. It's that simple. If you are looking to get rid of fat, you have to increase metabolism through muscle growth. That means you need to consume roughly 100 calories more than you burn. If you don't have an accurate picture of what you are burning, you are lost. If you want to weigh less, regardless of fat content, eat less than you burn. But the critical piece is what is missing from this watch.That being said, I will keep it anyway, because this particular watch keeps very accurate blood pressure, and It's a lot easier to do with a watch than messing around with a cuff. So at least it has that going for it. Before I bought this watch, I read the questions and reviews, and concluded that maybe this one would keep accurate caloric counts. Maybe there are watches out there that do. Mine does not. Some of the reviews said that the blood pressure was off. Mine is on the money with a cuff, so I haven't had that experience. But the makers of this watch need to find a way to track the entire calorie burn, not just calories from movement. Because the most vital purpose of the watch is a fail, the best I can give it is 2 stars. Sorry manufacturer, but that's the best I will do for this model."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Mueller,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsTough Smart Watch,2-Dec-22,"I primarily purchased this smart watch for its ruggedness and it has held up phenomenally.  I've owned this smart watch for about 3 months now and I've used worn it in the pool, hot tub, and sauna and never had a problem.  Battery life (which is great, lasts weeks at a time for me) has not degraded due to high heat from the sauna.Cons:  As for the features, I was disappointed that I wasn't able to receive notices for messages from Teams or Facebook Messenger.As far as size and comfort, it is rather large and sticks out farther from the wrist than I'd prefer but I can't really complain too much on that front since my primary reason for purchasing the smart watch was for it's ruggedness and rugged/thin just don't go together.On Accuracy, the step count is wildly off (too high).  Days I notice a large spike in steps seems to coincide with days I was driving, so I'm pretty sure it picks up vibrations while driving and thinks your walking the entire time...just a guess.Overall, if you're looking for a ruggedly built phone that can withstand high heat, swimming, and just plain getting knocked around a lot, this smart watch may be a good fit for you."
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,jakob Mayer,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsWorks for a month,18-Aug-23,This thing will work for a month and then stop talking to your phone so you will not get text messages. You will not get phone calls notifications through the watch so don’t buy this.
B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Bear Bear ,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood. But...,17-Aug-22,"The watch is nice, great battery life and does lots of things.How ever.1. The band it came with was sticky icky and i changed to the metal one you see on it.2. The thing is huge! Which is both good and bad. Good because i can see it with out my glasses, bad because i catch it on everything.3. None of the programs like the sleep tracer or step counter are editable, interactive or programable. You get exactly and only what it says. It tracks. Thats it. And not very accuratly. If you have restless sleep dont bother with this ones sleep tracker. It is the farthest thing from accurate.3. Step counter is so drastically off as to almost be comical. Im a big girl and i do about 5k steps aday according to  my main pedomiter. The watch says im pushing 15k steps a day. And though that makes me feel like a champ, its so grossly miscalculate that even my happy arse cant accept it.4. Waterproff yes. Hot tub proff yes. Shower proff.... not really. Every drop of hot water on tje screen turns it on and will randkmly start apps like music or excersize or the shutter. I have a wonderful collection of my bathrooms ceiling and walls now, thanks to it. Ok enough raggin. Why it is good.  Amazing battery life! Dispite beimg big enough to land a chopper on, it is comfy enough to wear while in minimal clothing.The screen is bright.  And it tells accurate  time!  The blood pressure,  O² sensor, heartrate monitor are honestly why i keep it. They are supper useful!"

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,fprimex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsRugged, responsive smartwatch with amazing battery and features for the cost.",21-Jun-22,"✅ Goes in the pool✅ Goes in the hot tub✅ Goes in the shower✅ Goes in the ocean✅ Goes in the sand✅ Gets sprayed with sunscreen✅ Gets sprayed with bug repellentStill works with no problem!I own an Apple watch also which ran me literally 6 times as much as this watch, and I think since I am a light smartwatch user I would be fine with just this one. It pairs for phone notifications, does heart rate and exercise tracking, and has alarms and timers.The best part has to be the battery life though. I recently spent a week at the beach, and rather than take my Apple watch and have to worry about it and charge it every night, I took this watch. I fully charged it before we left, left the charger at home, and when we got back it was still at 54%. It will literally hold charge for weeks.The UI is very, very responsive. Swiping around is nice and quick.I tested the heart rate monitor with one of those O2 sensor things you put on your finger and it was accurate.Now nothing is 100% perfect so here are some things I noticed.* Setup and some operations *requires* a phone. You cannot even set the time without a phone. This is a SMARTWATCH. If you're not going to at least pair it once with a phone this is not the watch for you. After the initial setup it functions independently, with only a couple of things like changing alarm times and getting the weather not working.* The features cannot be rearranged. Out of everything provided, I use the music controls the most to repeat and switch songs on my phone. This feature is the *last* one in the list, so if I ever leave it I have to swipe alllllll the way back.* The font used for notifications appears to not support emojis. If anyone sends you a smilely you're going to get a ""?"", then have to go to your phone to see it.All in all, it's an amazing product with a lot of value for the money. The watch firmware is upgradable, so if they fix any of the above issues, which I think is likely, it will be even better."

Very comfortable to wear and  stylish and the i recommend getting the protection plan if you do plan on getting one the 24 hour service team is super friendly and kept me updated and walk me through on getting my watch replace. and lasty the charger feels a lot more secure when i put my watch on it note these were my first ever smartwatch brand i have ever brought from haven't had any problems with them. can't go wrong  they do there best to make it right"

It connected perfectly to my phone and was easy to set up. The battery life has been better than my old Apple Watch, the steps counter appears to be accurate and the sleep tracking offers a ton of features. I've also used it to work out and measure my heart rate, and these have been accurate based on what I typically see for an average gym session. The blood oxygen feature takes a measurement, but I don't really know how to judge whether it's accurate or not. One thing to be aware of -- it's big! This may be a downside for some, but I like the larger screen and the fact that it looks like it could survive an apocalypse haha."

El contador de pasos es un poco impreciso y cuando lo comparo con el contador pasos del celular la diferencia ha llegado hasta de 2,000 pasos menos contados en el reloj. Hago la prueba caminando para ver la precisión y aparenta tener un delay al contar. He buscado la forma de calibrarlo, pero no veo ninguna opción en la configuración. Otro punto es que en ocasiones cuando elijo una rutina de ejercicio, aparentemente deja de contar los pasos. El otro aspecto a mejorar es que no hay muchas opciones para el aspecto de la pantalla, me hubiese gustado que tuviese la opción de un aspecto un poco más tradicional o reloj clásico.

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,DT,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsOk purchase.  Customer service is great.,29-May-23,Takes a little getting used to since I always use to wear a fitbit.  This BP monitor does not really work as it always returns the same results.  The fit is a bit bulky but overall ok.  The back of the watch catches the hairs on my arms and is annoying because the sensor is not flush and instead raised a bit which I did not experience with fitbit.  Customer service is excellent.  Overall happy with my purchase.

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Ces,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWorks Better Than Expected,11-May-23,"Watch looks great, was easy to pair with my phone. The ap is pretty simple but you have to be cool with giving it permissions as it demands access to EVERYTHING to function as anything but a step and sleep tracker. It tracks steps almost perfectly, but it is way, way off on distance. Ei I walked 4.5 miles in 97 minutes this AM. It got my steps right at 9256. Unfortunately, it says I only went 2.33 miles. No biggie since Google Maps tracks it as does Google Fitness, but it's silly that I had to give it access to literally everything on my phone except my Bank info (and it did ask for it, demanding it to use the ap which I had to manually block) and it can't track how far someone walks/bikes/rides/hikes etc. Phone calls are fine, alerts are fine, text are fine. The waterproof part is also 100% legit as I have soaked this thing numerous times and don't bother taking it off when I shower half of the time. Good product for the money."

B0BS3TZHBV,Watch B,Gary Patterson,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsGood Watch-Inadequate Software,24-Jul-23,"Everything about the watch is right on. But there are two major problems. The software supporting the watche's reporting functions is, at best, inconsistent. The sleep function may be very good or non existent, even when worn the exact same way each night. The second problem is the claims about the battery. I have never been able to get more than 5 days from one charge, even though the company claims up to 60 days! Just ain't so. If  they would straighten this all out, it would be an outstanding watch. As it is: unreliable, even worthless for anything other than keeping time."

If I could force compatibility with Facer I would easily rate it 5 stars.Besides all of that, I it's comfortable to wear and feels a bit more beefy and sturdy, especially the band than my previous watch from them.

First off, the smart watch was very easy to pair to my phone. I have an Android phone, and it only took a few minutes to pair the watch with my phone.First enable Bluetooth and find the device listed as ""C20""Next, download the app that's shown in the QR code. Once you have the watch paired via Bluetooth to your smart phone and the app is downloaded, your watch ready to go, and should be syncing to your smart phone. The connection has been great thus far; it hasn't disconnected/lost connection to my phone.As someone who has suffers from pulmonary lung disease, I was very excited when I found out this smart watch has the capability to track my oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. In addition, you don't have to do anything, the watch will automatically to measurements periodically throughout the day.It's helping me monitor and compare results over a few days. I suggest authorizing Google Fit so your hearth history is accessible when it. For me, it helps to have a history when I meet with my pulmonologist.The watch has great standby battery life, and it's light weight. After m three days  it's only dipped minimally in available battery percentage. I highly recommend this!**Updated**So it's been several days now since I first posted the review and I am amazed how little the battery has drained. Needless to say this smartwatch has fantastic standby battery life; especially considering it's constantly looking for/measuring heart rate. As you can see from the photos the readings are very accurate. I own a pulse oximeter and a blood pressure monitor to keep my pulmonary hypertension in check. My resting heart rate is 95 bpm, which may seem high, but the reading is accurate and normal which makes this product more the reassuring."

It was great until I went swimming and bumped a button. It flooded and I returned it.This watch has held up to water so far.  It uses the Da Fit app (same as Kopset). The BP, O2 sat, pulse, and step count are the same as other devices I compared it to, and same as the Dr's at a checkup I had.After 2 weeks on a single charge, the battery reads 40%.I paid about $40, so I could literally destroy about 10 of these before coming close to the cost of a Samsung watch I was considering."

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,JohnJohn,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood sports tracker watch,19-Nov-23,"This watch is good for sport/fitness tracking. Overall, I found that it's in line with other comparable products in the budget category. Its fitness tracking apps seem to work fine although I found its sleep tracking app to be wholly unreliable to draw any meaningful results from its statistics. Communications-wise, it's about average. I can answer and make calls, get notification prompts on text messages received or from other apps from my phone. I can't write or send texts with it unfortunately. It has Alexa-built in, but this is only useful if you've already subscribed to its ecosystem. To conclude, it's a good smartwatch to have if you're looking for a budget option optimized for fitness tracking."

Never owned a smart watch and couldn’t justify paying several hundred bucks for one.  I saw this one on sale and was willing to risk 40 bucks.  So far there’s nothing I dislike about the watch.  Plenty to like:  appearance, comfort, functionality, battery life.  I won’t list all the features/functions, but some highlights are vibration alerts, alarms, timers, answer calls, view messages and control music.  Like that I can be some distance from my phone and still get alerts and answer calls via Bluetooth.  Especially recommend this for a first time user to try out and see if it’s useful in your daily life.  It is in mine."

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Michelle Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsLittle details keep this from five stars.,14-Nov-23,"This watch seemed easy to set up. It took just about an hour total. I even have an older phone that isn't 5G. The watch can be hooked to Alexa, and plays music or podcasts through your phone. I have been able to make calls and read texts from it as well. Though you cannot go very far from your phone during a call.It is the little details that may keep me from giving this phone five stars. It does not consistently measure heart rate. I have to sit still to get it to take a reading of my heart rate.Compared to much smaller Fitbit Inspire 3 that measures heart rate even while I am exercising.The band is very thick and my skin doesn't like it much. I hope there is a fabric or metal band available that I am not allergic to.The step counter seems a bit off compared to the Fitbit as well. It is 56 steps behind. Now I am wearing the Fitbit on the left wrist so that could be the difference.Yet for the price, with all the options it carries, and a free app... You really cannot complain. It does almost everything it says it will. And I have only been wearing this one day. The bugs may work out over time."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,JackJack,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsI didn’t have high hopes for this, but I’m absolutely blown away by the quality",28-Sep-23,"This will have been my most in depth review to date on something so versatile as this “smart watch” with built-in Alexa capabilities. There’s many pro’s and con’s to this device, but let me start out by saying that I didn’t have very high expectations for a “smart device” with such a low price tag associated with it. The device itself has many great features–accuracy to be debatable. Overall, I’m pleased. Let’s dive a little deeper:Pro’s:- It has an incredible range, whereas another reviewer stated that it did not. For the price of this “smart watch” I’m absolutely blown away that my phone can be left in one room of the house, yet alert me to calls or text messages while in another room.- This device exceeded my expectations where battery life has come into play. It arrived with a 97% charge left, and I didn’t really leave it on the charging dongle but for a few minutes. I’d used it extensively for an entire 24 hours and it never dipped below 73%.- When placed on a charge, it charges incredibly fast. Several percent within a matter of five minutes. I’d anticipate this watch charging at least a good 40% while you took a decent shower and prepared for bedtime.- The watch can read a person’s heart rate, and oxygen saturation with a seemingly high accuracy–give or take 10bpm. (I don’t own a medical grade device to check this against, so I’m going by my usual heart rate readings when I check it with my finger.)- It seems to read your sleep patterns with high intuitiveness, but I have no way of proving its accuracy. (It said I had 13 steps at 4:45 this morning, yet I don’t remember getting out of bed even once.)- It has a ‘do not disturb’ feature, so you can tell it to stop alerting you about phone notifications for any length of time.- You have the ability to place a phone call directly from the watch, but the call itself needs to be handled on your phone. I don’t see myself using this function very often–if ever.Con’s:- It doesn’t have the capability of replying to text messages.- It can’t display emoji’s that somebody sends in their messages, nor pictures of any kind.- The charging cord is incredibly short (13 inches), though this can be remedied if you have USB extension cables.- The band it comes with is quite small. If you have a larger wrist like I do, you’ll be lucky to snap the buckle in its last available hole. And prolonged wearing, it will cause a swollen indent into your wrist. Not terribly uncomfortable, but I couldn’t see myself wearing it with the existing band more than 12 hours at a time.- The app it comes with (required to be downloaded prior to setting up the device itself) seems to have been developed/written in a country where English is not their primary language. It’s not a huge deal for me, but the grammar and spelling issues would certainly contrast next to a health tracking app from any leading company established in The USA. (Screenshot provided will show one example of this).For an off-brand piece of hardware that this is, I’m very pleased with it’s wide array of capabilities and functions.4 Very Promising Stars"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,RachelRachel,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsOverall solid smartwatch!,1-Oct-23,"Immediately out the box, the product warns you to charge before use, and to my delight it was already 99%, so I put it on. To less than my delight, the band is rather small, especially for a larger person like me. I can only comfortably fit on the very last hole. This isn't typical of watches or bands I've had in the past, even being a bigger girl, so I was confused. Just be warned if you are larger too, you may need to create your own hole, or find a larger band to replace the original with.Set up was easy, you need to have their app filled VeryFit downloaded. It is not compatible with MyFitnessPal, which is a bit of a bummer as I use that app to track my food and calories.I also still can't figure out how to get the sleep tracking to work. I enabled on the app to allow it to do smart sleep tracking, or something along those lines, because it's turned off by default for some reason. But my watch still just says to wear it while I sleep. I've never had this issue with smart watches in the past, so it's pretty weird.Also if you want a constantly updated heart beat monitor, you'll have to enable that in the settings. What good is a HRM if it only shows when I ask it to? I suppose it saves battery, but I don't mind just charging it while I shower or relax at my computer. After 3 days I was at 50% and felt I should charge it.Also as somebody who has a high refresh rate monitor and phone screen, the watch looks a bit choppy as far as frame rate, but you aren't the type of person to notice that stuff, it probably wouldn't bother you at all. I got used to it.Other than the sleep feature not working for me, and the band being a tight fit, overall this is a good bang for your buck. It looks professional, and my boss even mistook it for an apple watch, and he owns one. He was flabbergasted when I told him the price being so cheap.3/5 for comfort because of the band issue.3/5 for accuracy because I do think it reads my heart rate too high and doesn't read my sleep at all.5/5 for worth your money though because it's still a nice watch and I'd like to keep using it."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Jess B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood value for a smart watch,14-Nov-23,"This smart watch isn't on the level with more expensive models, but that's an unfair comparison, since it's far less expensive. I have a few smart watches. I'd say this watch brings 80% of the performance of my most expensive smart watch and it costs maybe 30% of what that one did. So I really can't complain.Sometimes, it's a little slow to turn on from a wrist turn like it's supposed to. I also don't love how it won't let me swipe away one notification at a time. But overall, that's minor stuff. It gets the job done. Also, the battery life is amazing. I charged it over a day ago and have been wearing it since. It's now at 70%. Pretty great! Overall, this is a very good value and does the job."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,MollyMolly,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsIt’s not HIGH quality- but works well.,8-Nov-23,"Overall, I really like this watch. It was easy to set up and (so far) functions well.It’s a vaguely similar look to an Apple Watch from a distance. Up close it’s pretty clear the watch face is thicker and lower quality than the real deal. The band feels a little flimsy, but has stated put really well.I have an iPhone X and am able to get my app notifications on this watch. The watch app is able to communicate with the Health app on your iPhone- but everything goes initially through the 3rd party watch app (VeryFit).The watch has some decent functions. SPO2, HR, Stress levels… it’s pretty cool. It says it’s able to track sleep- but I’m not sure how accurately it’s doing that for me.Something I thought was weird was the fact that you can PAY to get a different watch face display. There are some “free of charge” but others cost $0.49. After spending the money on a smart watch, I think people should have access to all of the content/capabilities without additional costs."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Sharon SSharon S,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsA great smartwatch with a drawback for me,12-Oct-23,"I have tried several smartwatches of this kind, and this one stands out for its ease of setup and use. At first, I was not impressed by the band, which looked cheap. But after wearing it for a day, I realized it was the most comfortable band I’ve ever had! It shows that you can’t judge a book by its cover.It paired quickly with my phone via Bluetooth, and the connection was stable. I could walk around most of my house without losing it. And when I came back in range, it reconnected smoothly.It supports all the usual notifications: text, email, social media, etc. It also has an activity tracker, a sleep tracker, and a monitor for heart rate, oxygen and stress levels. If you feel too stressed, you can use the breathing mode to help you relax. You can also check the current temperature and weather.Some features that I found useful were the flashlight, alarm and find my phone. I had to use the find my phone feature three times in three days because I didn’t need to carry my phone with me thanks to the watch’s range.You can make and receive calls through the watch, which worked well for me. However, you can’t listen to music or podcasts on the watch. This was a letdown. You can only use the music app to control the volume and move through the songs.The watch has more features than I mentioned. It’s fun to explore all that it can do.This watch uses the VeryFit app, which I don’t like very much. But that’s just my preference.For the price, this is a wonderful watch, packed with features, with a beautiful screen that is clear and easy to read. I deducted a star for not being able to listen to audio on the watch, which I enjoy doing."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Lola W.Lola W.,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsBasic functions but cute.,11-Nov-23,"I got this smart watch primarily to track my steps. So far it’s met my expectations in that area so I’m pleased. I also like that you can change the display pictures which is clear and bright and the screen is a good size. The regular things like seeing whose calling, texting and whatsapp alerts work fine as well. I don’t think you can respond to texts the only option you get is to delete it. The watch is pretty lightweight, the band is soft and comfortable on my wrist but I can’t find what size watch band it uses to get a replacement. A decent watch if you want something with basic functionality yet decent looking."

I can easily set up and pair with her phone. This watch comes with heartbeat monitoring, oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, these features are needed for a senior helping them to monitor their health which is amazing and important. The watch User Interface is simple and straightforward, even a non tech savvy can easily use it, icons/apps are sharp and nice."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Zed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsNot really a smart watch, but still excellent!",25-Sep-23,"The product description calls this a smart watch, but it isn’t. It can not make calls by itself and does not have a microphone or speaker.That being said, this is still a really nice watch! The bluetooth integration allows you to start and end calls from the watch, and you can easily track exercise. I love the ability to choose from watchfaces. I also LOVE the ability to set alarms on the watch. It’s much easier for me to turn off an alarm that is on my wrist.The only downside (other than this not being a true smart watch) is the way notifications behave. They just flash quickly and then are gone before I can read them. If they either displayed for longer or queued so I could review them on my own, then this would be a perfect product.UPDATE: I have been using this watch more and was able to figure out how to view notifications and now I’m a bigger fan! There are three ways to view on the watch: swipe sideways for tiles, swipe up for notifications, double press the side button for a menu. I’m still figuring out what configuration of tiles works best for me, but it’s much easier to navigate now that I know the different ways!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,MadyMady,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsa decent smart watch,6-Oct-23,"I like this watch. It has many features and its pretty simple to navigate. You can change the face with a ton of different choices and it seems pretty spot on for steps, oxygen saturation,heartbeats per min and stress levels. The sleep part does light deep and awake. I do wish it tracked REM.  The watch itself is easy to read and its clear to see what your numbers are. I do like that it shows the different data and breaks it down by the minutes which is pretty neat to see. The Bluetooth is crystal clear. Whenever I receive a call the other person can hear me just like I was on my phone. All in all, its a good smart watch and its pretty simple to use."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Ray Rickstrew,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsSmart watch yes but super simple,3-Oct-23,"Out of the box, charged it.  Set up was fast and easy.  Included apps are very minimal and simplistic.  Appearance is nice, very light and good touch screen.  I did not like the strap tucking into itself but that's just me.  I have not own a lot of smart watches so as a watch it is great.  The fitness part was not up to what I expected.  It did great on steps but when you want to check your heart rate you need to click on that app and wait 5-10 seconds.  It is a fun first smart watch and I definitely need to explore it a lot more.  I can't say if it is a good value since I don't have a lot of experience with smart watches, but I'll keep exploring the watch and get back to this review after a month of playing around with it."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,JMJJMJ,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsComfort, Useful, and Fashionable",26-Sep-23,"This watch was super easy to setup. I scanned the QR code which took me straight to the app to download, from there setup was self explanitory. The sound quality of a phone call is super clear and the display is on point. I'm actually very satisfied with this watch. It paired easily to Bluetooth, and the watch band is a soft non skin irritating material. It's kind of like a soft silicone material. The band closure tucks right under the band and it doesn't stick out like normal watches. The only downfall I have, and it may be because I haven't figured out to to maneuver the setting yet is that I can't voice respond to text messages when they're received. But that's ok,  I can at least see the text then grab my phone if it needs to be responded to immediately. I'm actually very satisfied with this smart watch. I would recommend. My teen actually likes this and said she would wear it. Imagine this, she actually said she was jealous,  so I'll be buying one for her."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Steve & Steph's RV AdventuresSteve & Steph's RV Adventures,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat features but touch screen not too responsive,12-Oct-23,"The media could not be loaded.                 This smart watch is a bargain based on all of the features it offers. The interface is clear and bright, and the app was an easy download on my Samsung Galaxy S21Plus. The watch connected easily per the instructions to my phone, and was ready to go.The first thing I would advise is to change the screen timeout under Settings, (on app or watch) because the screen timeout was set to like 2 seconds and that made it difficult to navigate.Most of the setup is easiest to do on the app, and then everything works well on the watch itself. You will get calls & app notifications, check the weather, use it as a pedometer to record steps (MUCH easier than carrying your phone for this purpose), get your heart rate & blood oxygen level, activate the camera (works as a ""remote"" for taking photos), record exercise, play music, and much more.One of my favorite things about the watch is that the end of the wristband tucks into the wristband so its not flopping around to get caught on things, which also provides a clean modern look.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the touch screen was not super responsive for me and it took a few taps and swipes to navigate."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Naima ,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsFunctional,7-Oct-23,"The smart watch is great for an alternative watch. It has a few good features. I use it for my everyday activities. It gives the steps walked, and calories burned. You can also set a reminder to drink water. A con is it doesn’t allow you to text. The battery life is great. I don’t have to charge it as much."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Richard B.Richard B.,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsFor the price, a good functional smart watch.",7-Nov-23,"The Smart Watch is solidly built with an all metal casing surrounding the plastic screen face.  It came with a 92% charge -- a good thing, no waiting for watch setup. The phone app setup was easy and fairly fast.  Pairing happened rapidly also.  The watch screen is bright with exceptionally clear and crisp watch face screens (My pics don't do it justice--I was in a ""bright"" setting for the photos).I have two other smart watches, one at a similar price and one much more expensive.  This watch, with all its functions, compares favorably with my current watches.  It is very fast (compared to my other watches) at loading and synchronizing different watch faces thru the app.  Watch faces are free or .49c to a few dollars each.  As with most smart watches, there is a ""multitude"" of choices.  The watch does only store 4-5 watch faces at a time, but deleting ones is easy with only a couple taps to delete when loading a new screen.  There are a variety of choices, but they don't seem to be as ""intricate"" as other watches I have.Charging is done with a USB connecting cable and a magnetically charged pin connector for the back of the watch.  When your connection is complete for charging, you get a vibration and screen ""light up"" to let you know it is charging.  Charge life is similar to other Smart Watches at 5-7 days with normal use.  It has one very nice feature -- just lifting your wrist upward activates the screen and dropping your wrist turns the screen off.  No shaking or rapid movement to get it to function. The band ""leaves something"" to be desired, but most, in this price range, are similar.  Accuracy may be an issue for some of the readings, but I am still testing its reading results, and can’t say at this point.  Overall this watch is a good value product in this price range."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Robert Carreon,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsDelightful and easy to use,30-Sep-23,"Great style/color and with a display area large enough for my 50+ year-old eyes to read easily.  Packed with features which my old watch did not have (Alexa and phone connectivity).  Comfortable and no cheap plastic feel.  It's supposed to be water proof, but I'm not sure if that means is able to be immersed or just splashed on.  I would not take it into the swimming pool (don't ask me how I know).  Came with tiny instructions, but otherwise I'm happy with this purchase.  For the price, I'd be satisfied if I get one year's use out of it."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,CJA,4.0 out of 5 stars,"4.0 out of 5 starsFor the price, its pretty good!",25-Sep-23,"I ended up liking this watch more than I thought I would especially knowing the asking price.  I paired this with a Pixel 6A, and it worked great for tracking sleep, heart, steps, and plenty of other things.  It also ties into the phone so you can read messages, answer the phone, and change the music.  I also paired this with an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it works like a charm.  The notification sounds that come out of this watch are also the same that can be found on an Apple Watch.  There is no App store to download new apps; however, most of the apps that are built into this watch are what most people use when they buy one of these smart watches.  I can highly recommend this watch!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Ms AmandaMs Amanda,4.0 out of 5 stars4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsReally nice smart watch,28-Sep-23,We recieved this smart watch with built in Alexa capabilities. I ordered it for my daughter so she would be more mindfull of her activity and because she always says she can't keep track of time even though she has a smart phone.This little watch packs a punch with many of the same features name brand smart watches have. It tracks her sleep heart rate step count depending on the clock face you have set it also shows date and Day. It connects to Alexa your emails text messaging and phone. It even has a built mic so you can actually  answer calls right from you watch.My daughter loves it and we recommend
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Justin,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsPairs with Apple or Android,21-Sep-23,"At first glance, it is lightweight, but just feels cheap and the band looks it.  But when you turn it on and use it, it is very functional.  Alexa is a nice addition and allows you to do voice commands and such without having to have an apple or google.  This watch also has fitness trackers and such that higher end watches have.  The watch is a bit laggy on the swipe and in apps, but this is a fraction of other brands and does much the same.  Not sure if the wrist bands are as changeable as other brands, but it would be nice to get different colors.  Overall, worth the buy though. I’m amazed they can put so much in for such an affordable range."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,brandibrandi,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsVery good off-brand smart watch,10-Oct-23,"I have been wearing this smart watch since the day it arrived.  While this is my first smart watch, the rest of my family has been using them with their fruit-brand phones.  I have the other type of phone and this was easy to pair and sync with it - it took less than a minute to download and install the app and pair with the watch.  I then compared the features of this watch with my family members' devices and this one includes nearly all the same features.  ""find phone"" is quite helpful. - timer/stopwatch/alarm (on the watch) separate from the phone - steps, goals, activity tracker, etc. were all the same, albeit they look different and finding them took a little trial and error.  The band is comfortable being soft silicone and i really like how the extra band tucks under the other side so nothing is loose and flapping around.  Changing the watch face appearance was very easy through the app, although the watch itself can only store 3-4 different styles depending on the size of the file.  Browsing through the app, some styles were available for purchase, but there were plenty that appealed to me which were free and ranged from simple to highly detailed - digital and analog.  The watch holds a charge well and the magnetic cable works well although the cable could be longer than 6-8"".  It's tight but it still reaches the nightstand. Overall I am very pleased with this watch and I don't think I have fully explored all of the possibilities yet.  At a fraction of the price of other fruit-brand watches, this is an incredible bargain and a solid product.Edit Oct 24, 2023:  The app connected to this smart watch performed an update to the firmware for this watch.  In total, the update took about 5 minutes and there were no issues with the download or installation.  It surprised me a little bit that the vendor felt it necessary to perform an update (have not found the release notes yet) on the firmware and make improvements for any who might be trying this watch out.  Because everything went so smoothly and they care enough to continue working on the product, I felt it deserved an edit to my review to communicate that it seems they (ENOMIR) are still investing in their product and standing behind it to ensure a great user experience."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Kaley NighKaley Nigh,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI love this smart watch!,13-Nov-23,"So, I already had a smartwatch, but I was sold on this beauty because it has Alexa, which is fantastic. I wore both watches (one on each wrist) for a couple of days to test and compare them, this is what I found:-Very different ranges for steps and kcal.-This watch's sleep tracking is much better, showing when you were in which sleep cycle (light, heavy, REM).-Alexa on this watch is a game changer.This watch is super easy to use. As with other smartwatches, you need to download an app (VeryFit in this case), and the app is great! I appreciate the MANY features of this watch: Alarm setting, Alexa, sleep tracking, pedometer (step count), heart rate, sp02, phone connectivity (you can actually have a phone conversation THROUGH the watch! Other watches I've had only controlled the phone), activity monitoring, health monitoring (water reminders, female cycle reminders, sedentary reminders, stress monitoring), a meditation/breathing feature, weather, music, camera control, and find phone.I would say the value for money is great. High quality UX and UI, intuitive. The only tiny complaint I have (not even big enough to lose a star) is that the watch band itself appears to be a little cheap. It's a silicone band, but the buckle and clasp are made of plastic. I would have preferred metal. No big deal, I can always switch out bands!All in all, 5 out of 5 stars. I love it, the battery lasts nicely."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,KOZIS,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSurprisingly pleasant,7-Nov-23,"This watch comes with a surprisingly pleasant. With $60 I didn't have high hope, thought it might be a fancy toy, but it indeed is pretty nice. It of course doesn't have all the features like an Apple Watch, but it is very solid for a daily smart watch, at some areas are actually better.What I like:- Lightweight, it feels very light on my wrist, you almost feel it's nothing compare to an Apple Watch, esp Ultra. So comfortable to wear;- Battery life, with a full charge after a full 24 hours of usage, the battery only dropped a little over 10%, I have no doubt it will last couple of days with one full charge, much better than Apple Watch that requires almost daily charging;- Display, very good display, honestly can't tell the difference from those big brands. Sharp, clear and high resolution.- All the essential features that just work, heart rate, SPO2, activity monitor, sleep monitor, they all seem to be working just fine, and in par with the high end sports watch. Reliable is the key, and this watch is reliable.- App, it has its own dedicated app so you can keep the watch sync with your phone. It looks they spent time and resource to really develop the app, check out the review on the app you will see.Of course there are some features lacking, such as no onboard music, no bluetooth headset connectivity, but again you are just spending a fraction to get a reliable working smart watch, that looks great on your wrist. I highly recommend."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starspretty good watch,5-Oct-23,"This watch is pretty nice. I like the flexibility, the fact that it monitors my sleep, heart rate, and oxygen in addition to the normal smart-watch features of detecting exercise and showing me phone notifications. Some of the UI elements were confusing, but swiping up / down / left from the various edges seems to be the trick for accessing most of them."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,PaulPaul,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis inexpensive smart watch offers a ton of functionality for its price.,3-Oct-23,"Hi. I picked up this Enomir smart watch for an immediate family member who wanted to wanted to see if she’d like using a swipe screen watch. To that end, I’ve set up the watch for her and have spent quality time with it on my own exploring its features and functionality. The following is a quick review of what I’ve discovered so far ….- My impressions about this watch are almost entirely positive. (More about the “almost” in a bit.)  The screen is bright, crisp, and very easy to read.  Numbers, letters, and symbols are all sharply defined and stand out clearly against the colors of face’s various background. The screen’s swipe function works smoothly and reliably. For folks who are new to smart watches, it’s a motion that feels natural, and becomes second nature, quite quickly.  That it works this well on a $35 watch is impressive.- The exercise and health apps included with this entry level watch run the gamut from simple (step counter, digital and analog face timekeeping) to surprising (blood oxygen, heart rate and sleep monitor).  I’ve compared this watch’s blood oxygen and heart-rate results with the output of other devices I own and the numbers are almost always “spitting distance” close.- The charging cable that comes with this watch has a magnetic connector that is unique.  This cable is used with a 5 volt wall charger and has a standard, full size, USB-B connector on one end and a connector that has (two) magnets and (two) contacts on its opposite end.  This connector attaches to an area on the backside of the watch at its upper center. (See photos above).  This is the first time that I’ve encountered this type of connector, and it is (now) the only one in our house.  I have neither a spare, nor a workaround, if the original cable goes missing.  This is the “almost” I alluded to in my introduction to this review; having a non-standard … unique …. charging cable is the one thing about the watch that gives me pause.The takeaway:  This is an inexpensive, easy to use, customizable smart watch that comes loaded with built-in exercise, health, and sleep monitoring apps."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,caleb me,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 stars4 star watch, but I give 5 for the price.",9-Nov-23,"This watch is a very good value, and is a great option if you want to try out a smart watch without dishing out a few hundred dollars.-Pros:-The watch responds pretty quickly to input-Very simple one button design-Customizable faces and screens/menus/pages-Very easy to replace band that does not seem easy to fall off-Lets you turn of most features/pages that you do not want, which saves battery-Has a microphone and a speaker, allowing you to take calls without picking up your phone, although the quality is not great-Cons:-Somewhat limited on face options, you cannot customize each face preset and some faces are paid.-Will not let you use certain features unless you make an account which requires some personal health information-There appears to be no way to reply to texts on the watch-Call history only shows calls made with the watch-Most of the features appear to be focused only on health tracking, more time should have been spent perfecting the notification and communication parts"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,David Hua,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood quality and Features for the price,10-Nov-23,"The build quality of the watch is good. The watch feels substantial and wearing the watch is comfortable with nothing poking into my wrist nor the band grinding my skin while wearing it. The screen looks decent and is responsive to touch; it's not the clearest screen but for the price and the fact that it's not a screen that one would expect to be 4k resolution means that the slight blemish that is the blurriness of the screen is easily forgivable.The watch is able to monitor heart rate, breathing, sleeping, pretty accurately and can be used for calls, music, and notification management although it is not possible to see what messages you receive, just that you have received them. There is also a bit of customization that can be done for what is displayed on the main screen of the watch so if you want to view your heartrate, stress, and breathing along with the time you can."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,UnbiasedAlways,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsFeels a bit cheaply made,20-Nov-23,"Granted this is the very first smart watch I've ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to. But in my opinion it does feel a bit cheap. And the interfaces seem a bit low tech to me.. I actually haven't worn it much.. I don't know if i'm just hypersensitive to emfs but I definitely feel what I would describe as electronic irritation/radiation. So I haven't worn it to track my sleep or much else to be honest. It's not for me."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,CKem,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat for monitoring sleep quality,15-Nov-23,"I compared this watch to another smart watch I have for monitoring sleep quality. This one is definitely more accurate in measuring total sleep time and  reports more information. I like that this watch reports REM, light sleep, and deep sleep and indicates whether the duration is low, normal, or high. It also gives a sleep quality score. The watch was very easy to set up. After only a couple of days, it is evident that it has  a long battery life. I have checked other functions of the watch and they all work fine. For me, measuring sleep quality is what matters and this watch is very good for that."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Javier k,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsPretty great smartwatch,15-Nov-23,"I have 2 of theses and there are really nice , the price point is awesome compared to other major advertised brands that do practically the same thing. The battery lie on this thing is crazy , they say about a 4 or five days but trust me it takes only about 40% on a full week of wear so far . There are tons of features to use , blood pressure  , heart rate and blood oxygen. Just to name a few.  It wears very comfortable without any irritation, and looks great. Set up was pretty easy once you download the app and connect it with Bluetooth and everything functions very well very responsive"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,BonnieBonnie,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsI really like the watch itself, the band is the only downfall I could find.",1-Oct-23,"The watch does everything a Fitbit does but a lot cheaper.  I had a smaller watch and could barely read the date, time and steps, which was my main purpose for having one.  On this one, I can read everything at a quick glance.  I love that.I like the swipe option to the different menus, so easy to use.  It has so many additional options that I never thought I would use until I tried them (now I'm hooked).  The Alexa menu works better than my husbands watch.  I turned on the kitchen light and started the pool pump while sitting in the screened room.  It also connects to my phone so I can listen to my music from the watch.  And to my surprise, it sounds pretty good.  Since it's connected to my phone, I can talk and listen (hands free) without a funny looking earpiece attached to my head.  I like the quick glance of my text messages, as they come in and you can even see a partial of the last text from multiple contacts.  That way you know if you missed one.Now, for the bad part......the wristband.  I admit is comfortable because of the soft plastic it is made from but don't get any water under it.  Even the smallest drop of water causes it stick to your wrist.  I wasn't impressed with the way the band fits into itself on the back of your wrist.  If you have it tight (too tight) it will stay put but then it's uncomfortable on your wrist.  If you loosen it up, so it's comfortable, then the band seems to creep out of it's pocket and you need to adjust it every once in a while.Overall, I am really impressed with the watch itself and would definitely recommend this~!!!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,MrXtacyMrXtacy,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood Alternative to Other Watches,18-Nov-23,"First impressions,  the watch comes in a nice box.  Once turned on, you will need to download the APP to setup.  Setting up the connection between your phone and the watch is simple.  I connected to Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and it worked fine making and receiving calls.  I have not tried any of the other functions. My one complaint is that the charging cable is not USB-C and it is very short at 20 inch.  I can't charge it next to me because of the short cable."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Jasmyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat little watch!,18-Nov-23,I really like this smart watch! It does quite alot and is a very good price! I use it for counting steps and making sure I don't miss phone calls when my 5 year old had my phone. My only complaint is that you can't send texts from it. But you can make phone calls from it. The battery lasts FOR DAYS!! Literally iv gone 4 days without charging it!  For the price and it's capabilities it's a really good watch! It's definitely worth the money!
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Jae,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWas skeptical at first,21-Nov-23,"I was very skeptical at first I must say, but this watch surprised me.

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Andy,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis must be what Batman feels like,7-Nov-23,"Who doesn't want they're own personal Alfred or Ask Jeeves (uh-huh, uh-huh, age check!) Not only is this watch simply stylish, it' so efficient, too! My biggest gripe with fitness trackers is that they always lose sync. This tracker has not missed a single step (wink) with me! Safe to say, I'm obsessed. Almost as obsessed as this tracker is with me, haha. I love that the interface display is nice and big, I can really see any and all my stats at a glance. And the dial pad is sized enough that I don't struggle to make calls either.  This watch makes the perfect productivity side-kick. Highly recommend!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,javajeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsGot this for my daughter, even though she doesn't have a phone. She loves it.",16-Oct-23,"I gave this watch to my teenage daughter as one of her birthday gifts, even though she does not have a phone, yet.I was able to configure this using my android phone and was able to set it up for her.  It keeps track of how many steps she takes at school, her pulse and sleep schedule. It has a clear easy to read display. When she does get a phone, she will be able to sync this to her phone. We tried out the phone calls, alexa, text messages  and it seem work well, as long as you are within bluetooth range of your phone. It has timers and an alarm clock. I can't seem to get it away from my daughter long enough to try much more.I was very impressed by the battery-life, it seems to last several days and can recharge in a few hours.This makes a good first smart-watch to learn what it can do and decide if this kind of thing is for you.  If you lose it, you can find it with your phone... ... and even if you can't, it wasn't too expensive.Most importantly, she was able to look like the cool kid on campus with her smart watch."

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Joe L,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsAn Incredibly Well-Made Smart Watch!,11-Nov-23,"I don't understand how this watch can be so inexpensive.  It has all the basic functions - notifications, health monitoring, vivid display, music controls and EVEN a good quality microphone and a speaker for phone conversations!  The battery also lasts for day.  I can't tell you how long it will last, but I am truly impressed with its quality and featured.  It's perfectly suitable for adults who need relatively full-featured smart watch or for your child given its price point.  I highly recommend this watch."

It records your oxygen level3.It records your sleep - this feature is very important to me as i need to know how well I am sleeping and how much deep/ light sleep am actually getting4. It has very many features in terms of the works outs that you can do so this truly motivates one to literally work out5. It shows you distance walked/ ran / calories burnt /date  all on the same page - meaning you can customize what you want to see on the face of the watch ..I can write 1000 lines about how i feel about this watch.. one last thing.. my husband's watch cant come close to this one....because they are NOT the same .I am very very satisfied customer ."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Tommy Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat watch,10-Nov-23,This little watch is great.  Works well.  App is pretty easy to navigate as well.  Makes a perfect smart watch for the kids or for you if you don't want to spend several hundred bucks on one of the big name brand watches.  It fits well and it's comfortable.  I compared it to my fitbit for about a week and they were always within several hundred steps of each other throughout the day.

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,TripleF,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsGreat battery life, easy to use, entry level smart watch",27-Sep-23,"First impressions out of if the box were the following:Good build on the watch piece, cheap feeling watch band (can be replaced), charging cable is very short.Full use review:I put this watch on, on a Friday evening at 100% charge. I used it throughout the weekend, with normal use. It took until Tuesday afternoon for it to get down to 10%! I was amazed, as my premium level smart watch never has lasted more than 18 hours, maybe, unless I switch to power saving. For my first weekend I had some notifications on (I turned off everything but the messaging app that I use), and I had it set to constantly monitor my heart rate, so without that it likely would have lasted quite a bit longer. I also only had the display set at about 20% brightness, but honestly that didn't impede me from using it, and I prefer bright things.When you pull down from the top of the screen of the watch, there are nine options that you can toggle:Do not disturb - this makes it so that your watch doesn't actively give you notifications.Screen brightness - each tap increases the brightness by 20%. After it reaches 100% it drops back to 20%.Wake gesture - this manages whether the watch wakes up when you turn your wrists towards you, or not.Flashlight - this turns the screen on full brightness with a white background to give you some light.Water drop - I only tested this, but when you press it the watch starts vibrating and says something like ""draining watch"" and then says to shake the watch out to get the rest the water out. Clearly for use when the watch has been exposed to/submerged in water. I didn't really submerge my watch in the time I've had it, as I take it off to shower, etc.Settings - this is where you can adjust various things like how long you want the screen to be on, turn on power saving mode, turn on silent mode, etc.Alarm clock - you can set an alarm on the watch.Power save mode - as described.Find my phone - helps activate your phone so you can find it.So those are the main settings on the pull down.The options seem very basic while also providing robust access to quick options on the watch.Dragging across the watch face from right to left, or vice versa, scrolls through various app options/views, like Alexa, your exercise recording options, your sleep information (just for the most recent period, the history is available in the phone app), music control, and the SpO2 measurement tool.The watch connects to your phone using the VeryFit app, where you can get new watch faces, get your various data points from the watch (exercise, sleep data, etc,.), as well as manage which notifications the watch pushes to you. I like the app, if feels easy to use (for me), and easily syncs data with the watch, as long as it's connected. This isn't an app review, specifically, because It's not part of the watch directly, but you do need it to help manage the watch.Finally, the charging cable. First, it is only about 12"" in length. This is frustrating because I normally charge my watch on my desk, not near the plug itself. Second, the connection to whatever charging source you're using is USB-A, which is a bit old school at this point. That said, plenty of things still have USB-A inputs, so it's not a deal breaker for me. Third, the end that connects to the watch looks proprietary, so if you lose it, I'm not sure how you'd go about getting a replacement, and you couldn't just use a charger from another watch. There's no wireless charging option, so you need the cable.There are a few things the watch does NOT have, to be expected at this price, but I figured I'd list the things I noticed the watch doesn't have/can't do, in case that's relevant for anyone.LACKING FEATURES:1) No access to a watch based tap-to-pay system, such as Google wallet, Samsung pay, etc. You cannot use this watch to pay for things. I'm fine with that, but worth mentioning in case that's an option someone is looking for.2) No screen sleep sensor on the watch face. What I mean is, some watches, you can either just cover the face to quickly turn the screen off, rather than flicking your wrist out or waiting for the screen to turn off. This watch doesn't have that. It's not a big deal to me, but if you're used to that, it's worth knowing.3) There are no additional apps for this watch that you can install, so what you get out of the box is all you get.OVERALL:I'm very happy with this watch, especially at this price point. The battery life was a pleasant surprise, the watch is light weight, and does a great job of providing insights on some basic health things. The charging cable situation could be a headache at some point, but it gets the job done. Integration to the phone is easy and you get access to a few new watch faces through that, as well as your health data. I'd recommend this watch to someone who likes the idea of having a smart watch that does track a few health things, and doesn't need more."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Avid reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsVery helpful to track your steps and your sleep,22-Oct-23,"Downside is that this watch does not have any functionality without the app, however, once you download the app and sign in to Alexa, you have some great functions. I like the step tracker as I think it is more accurate than my phone which I don’t always carry on me when I walk around the house or at work. I especially love the sleep tracker as it has helped me realize I was not getting enough sleep, which is why I was likely getting more migraines. Once I realized my sleep habits needed to be changed, and I started getting more sleep, my migraines have decreased and I am also getting in more steps bc it feels so nice to have the instant feedback when i meet my calorie or step goals for the day. For all its drawbacks, I credit this little watch in tremendously improving my overall health - which was quite unexpected!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,00Thunder,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsReally good for the price!,8-Nov-23,Honestly I'm amused by how good the watch is given the price point. I was expecting some low end watch that fails a lot or doesn't have a lot to offer but this one really does! It tracks various things and for the price it's worth it. my only complain is that sometimes it doesn't sync if you close the app so just open it once and forget about it. don't close it.
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Sara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsWho needs the high priced one, not me",11-Nov-23,"I bought a watch like this one and loved it so much I bought TWO more as gifts!! I was shocked everything it can do for the price. It is a steal of a deal. The only thing it can not do is write texts, but that is ok with me. This smartwatch is outstanding!!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Justin Case,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsNice to look at,22-Oct-23,"It's a nice watch, I just wish the touch screen responded better. It's a smart watch and everything shows up on it that you'd expect but when I touch the screen it's unresponsive at times. Which is frustrating when I have a message come in or I'm trying to read something when my phone is somewhere in the other room"

From counting steps,  heart rate and sleep monitor to receiving and making calls this watch has it all. Perfect for gift giving and using one yourself. 👌"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,MDelloRussoMDelloRusso,3.0 out of 5 stars3.0 out of 5 stars,"3.0 out of 5 starsGood watch, but inaccurate measurements.",4-Oct-23,"App download for the phone is 94mb. Pairing the watch to my Android phone was super easy and almost instantaneous. Email authentication required, but I never received the email to authenticate on the watch even after doing it a couple of times making sure i put in the correct email address. Maybe it will eventually come, it is something that you can do later on in the app.There is a large quantity of watch faces in the dedicated app store, all of which are free. Some of them are really nice.There are many handy health related settings, exercise monitoring, oxygen and pulse, stress and sleep quality. Weather, music control, camera control, step counter and others. It does have Alexa built in but I have not used it yet, until I get more confident about where my login information is going as its a basic interface asking you for your Amazon username and password. That was to be expected, I'll get to it because that is one of the things that really interested me about this watch.One of the major features of this watch is health monitoring. For that reason I decided to test it out against a medical grade oximeter which measures both blood oxygen and pulse accurately. I do understand that all of these watches no matter what brand are not medical grade, but some are very close if not identical to actual readings. This one, was not. As you can see in the attached photos, the first being my blood oxygen, the watch stated 94% while the oximeter measured 98% (I am sitting at my desk, not active). The second shows my pulse, watch showed 80 and oximeter showed 75. That is within reason for a watch, however the difference in the blood oxygen measurement might cause someone to get worried. I verified that it was routinely off on this measurement several times by a good portion. I made sure the watch was secure on my wrist and tight when I took the measurements. Please note that there is always a possibility of human error when taking these measurements with a watch.The watch band fits well and is comfortable, standard vinyl feel rubber white band. Soft and flexible. The watch itself has one button on it to control functions, and the interface is touch sensitive swiping left and right. I believe the watch itself is plastic but convincingly looks like aluminum.I rated this a 3 out of 5 due to the inaccuracies of the watch's health measurements. But, for the cost, its stylish, functional, everything on it works with Android, and it really does have a lot of options, especially free watch faces which was very nice to see."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,amazonaddict,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsPleasantly surprised,29-Sep-23,"I wasn't expecting much with this watch but I have been pleasantly surprised.Firstly you should know that I'm a senior but I'm pretty good with electronics. Even though I can set most tech items up and program them I sometimes have questions and need a little help. I did not with this watch. Once I got it downloaded everything was so easy. I've had fun messing around with the apps, especially the heart rate monitor and the breathing app.Things I like: it's easy to use, the graphics are clear and easy to read, the instructions are easy to follow, it's quick & easy to set up, the watchband it easy to remove to change, it charges easy.Things I would change: the find my phone volume is not very loud even at the highest setting, the charger cord could be longer, there could be a battery status indicator on the face. Maybe one of the available home screens has that option but I haven't searched them all yet.I have been thinking about switching to a name brand watch similar to this so this is a good watch to learn on and see if I like it. I actually like it enough so far that I think I'll just stick with this one!"
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,JW,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat quality smart watch,10-Oct-23,"This smartwatch is great.  It is well designed and the setup is easy and straightforward.  I use this smartwatch to stay updated with notifications, customize alerts, and answer calls quickly via Bluetooth.  It helps me monitor my health 24/7, tracking heart rate, sleep quality, oxygen level, and many more.  I also enjoy its exercise tracking features and waterproof design for swimming.  It serves as a helpful life assistant with alarms and even lets me use my photos as watch faces.  The long battery life and quick charging make it very convenient.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this smartwatch."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Jeremy S. Lepel,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood fitness watch,12-Oct-23,"We like the clear screen on this watch, as well as the features for fitness tracking, sleep tracking, heart rate, blood oxygen, stress level, and the app shows more. Sometimes the graphics can be glitchy but only for a moment. the sensor can be a little picky, we've had nights were it doesn't record any respiration changes when we know there have been apnea episodes. This may need further troubleshooting. During the day its pretty good and has recorded all of included functions. We've started to reset the watch or check the sensors before sleeping to make sure all of the sleep gets recorded properly. Charging hasn't really been an issue, just do it during a downtime activity."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,SueLynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsWonderful tool, lots of features!",8-Oct-23,"Such an easy watch to set up, and it has so many beneficial tools. Keeps track of heart rate, oxygen level, pulse, stress level, steps. It has a great sleep app, keeps track of three levels of sleep - light, deep and REM, plus oxygen level and number of breaths per minute. All this plus you get notifications from you online apps - YouTube, email, texts, etc AND you can answer calls from your phone. It's an attractive watch, comes with an attractive wrist band and as far as I can tell all the functions are fairly accurate.  Battery lasts a couple of days as well, which is super nice. Did I mention it tells you the time of day as well? :)  You can hook it up to Alexa if you want, but I haven't done that."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Azhar Ahmed,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGlad I purchased this watch,20-Oct-23,"I was little hesitant initially to get this watch due to the price comparison with big names. I am surprised after using this watch for a week. This is the best smart watch that anyone can get at the given price. I got this to track/monitor my pickleball activity and this watch is capable of doing lot more. I am loving it, go ahead and get it, you will not regret."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Belews Reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Smart Watch,2-Oct-23,"I loved the first one so much, I ordered this one for my spouse.The included pamphlet goes through basic setup, but for detailed use, you pretty much have to navigate the watch on your own and figure things out.Everything is pretty straight-forward and simple enough to use. If you can operate a smart phone, you can figure out this watch.It has a step counter that works accurately, a heart rate monitor that can sometimes show an incorrect reading if it's not getting consistent contact (like during a run), but you can stop for just a few seconds for an accurate reading.There are lots of watch faces available free for download, and also premium faces available for purchase.It has weather, tells me how much sleep I'm getting and includes a chart showing light sleep and deep sleep, stress monitor, Alexa, and phone and text notifications.Not sure how long the battery would last without charging, but I charge it once a week anyway.Very pleased with it and would definitely recommend it."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Steve HeiseSteve Heise,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Budget-Friendly Option,22-Sep-23,"As a tech reviewer who reviews a lot of smart watches, you get used to seeing the same thing all the time. But this watch really stands out. First of all it looks absolutely amazing. It has a nice aluminum design and yet still manages to be lightweight and comfortable to wear. Also, another thing that stands out about this watch is the ability to customize watch faces. On a lot of watches, you get stuck with five watch faces that you don’t really like and you can’t delete them. You basically only have one customizable face. But on this one, you can actually keep or delete any of the watch faces. That’s a small thing but that’s a really nice touch. Now in terms of accuracy, I’ve been wearing this along with one of my other watches on a daily basis, and it seems to be in agreement with everything.  This watch appears to be genuinely accurate in terms of steps, mileage, calories, health monitoring, etc. Also, another thing that I like is the user interface is easy to operate and just genuinely good looking.  Overall, I’m really impressed with what a bargain this watch is. For anyone looking for a budget, friendly, smart watch or for anyone who is just looking for the very first smart watch I would definitely recommend this watch."
B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,PJPJ,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat features - good voice call quality,8-Oct-23,"Really good watch. Must keep ""very fit"" app running on phone. If you choose the app on phone, your watch will lose connection. Battery lasts a long time if you turn off automatic blood pressure measuring and 'wake when lift arm' feature. Big display. Comes with a few free watch faces to try. More options available for purchase. Call quality is good, works great. Text messaging is receive only, you can't respond, which is enough for me. Other features include steps, exercises, breathing, stress, blood oxygen, sleep and pulse measurements. Also Alexa feature to connect to your other devices. I find it useful, but must keep watch app open on phone for it to work. Lots of features. Highly recommend this watch. 5 stars."

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,ROXANNE,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsWas very skeptical at first,20-Nov-23,I was very skeptical of this at first. I didn't see how a smart watch could be beneficial. It is too small to read text messages and if I want to answer a phone call I will use my phone. It took a little while but I finally got that first call that I would have missed if not for the watch. Then I started looking into other things that it can do. I probably don't use it as much as it could be used but I'm coming out of the dark ages.

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,Gurtar Man,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsNeeds app to operate. Somewhat functional.,30-Sep-23,"I have to say that perhaps I am biased because I have owned a Fitbit before and am accustomed to the accuracy. The only thing about this watch I trust as far as accuracy goes, is that it tells time very well.I took my blood pressure with my regular cuff meter and it measured 116/65 which is pretty normal for me. I used the watch to check my blood pressure right after that, and it measured 159/92. I know that can't be right.Just to give it the benefit of a doubt I tried the walking measurement feature. The number of steps are recorded erratically - I could walk 20 feet and it would register 5 steps, then I could just move the watch up and down in my hand and it measured 70 steps. Not accurate at all.The band is cheap plastic and it looks horrible in my opinion.All in all, the fact that you have to download an app just to get the watch to work, then that it only works well as a watch... I just had to go with three stars."

You’ll need to download their VeryFit App which is easy to do.  Everything you need for set-up and use can be found there.  It has fun options to personalize it like multiple free faces from which to choose.  It’s thin, lightweight, and attractive.  The band is soft and flexible and has a quick release spring bars, so you could easily change it if you wanted to.  I’ve been wearing it for about a week now and don’t have any complaints about the battery life.  Overall, I’m very satisfied with the watch and consider it a great value."

It was really easy for her to set up using the included instructions and the app that it has her download. And she really likes the fact that it keeps track of her heart rate and let her know if she needs to take a minute to breathe and calm down. The strap is really comfortable on the wrist and the screen is just the right size to be able to see the messages and to see who’s calling her when needed. It’s a great value for money and it’s very accurate with the information that it provides and overall a comfortable watch for her to wear."

I have owned fitbits and a variety of other fitness tracking/smartwatches...and for the price of this one it can't be beat. It works very well and can be so useful. I love being able to keep up with my heart rate, how much sleep I am getting each night, and how many steps I've taken. It can even track your menstrual cycle and send you an alert reminding you before you start your next one. I can even control my music and check my weather from this thing! I answered a phonecall from my husband, while out shopping today, from my lovely new watch. It was so nice not having to shuffle through my purse to find my cellphone to answer a call. The call quality was amazing and we could hear each other very well. I am completely satisfied and very pleased with this item. I would 100 percent recommend!"

B0C2YB2G8S,Watch C,nUSA,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI can hear when a call comes in,13-Sep-23,"with the TV on and I wear two hearing aids. There are a few watch faces that you can use, and a more for .49 and more for .99. When you turn your arm or put some pressure on it, the display lights up for a full second. It has a lot in the app that you can choose from so far as exercise (over 100) and of course the various settings. I like the color of the green band, which they call pea, but I would call mint. I have had to order different bands because of allergies to fake rubber as the doctor calls it.As with all of the smartphone apps, some of it is accurate and some of it isn't. I have found that out of the three or four apps I've used with various watches, this one provides more information and ""suggestions/tips"" than others and actually has ways in the app to follow them if you choose.Overall I am more pleased with this app than any I have used, I like the watch (display, sounds, etc) and for the price, you can't beat it."

The touch/smart screen is a great size for my old eyes! I love this watch - the color, the functions and the ease of use. I'm very happy with this watch."

It is waterproof and it can track your exercise (run, walk, swim, etc.). It will monitor your fitness goals, calories burned, steps, exercise time and distance for a variety of activities.  It tracks your heart rate, blood oxygen levels and sleep patterns. The watch can hold a charge for 7 days before needing to be charged again. You can get “wrist calls” which tell you, you have a call on your iPhone or smart phone. The watch bands are very easy to change. It is a lovely watch for a gift or for yourself."

Boy, was I proven wrong.I would compare this watch to my original Fitbit Versa, it has a lot of the same features, if not more. Beyond tracking all the usual stuff like steps, calories, and exercise; it also tracks sleep, heart rate, and it's water resistant. You can also connect it to Alexa to the an assistant at your wrist at all times. With the app (downloadable for Android or iOS) you are able to make tweak the settings and change the watch face to a variety of free and paid ones.For the price, this is an amazing product that has all the same features of more expensive watches. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one for my son who is 12 and thought the watch was ""cool""."

Setup in the app was quick and easy. I charged it to 100% and have been using it everyday for a week and a half and the battery is at 50% so this is great. The band wasn't as pink as I thought but it is still pretty and bands are very easy to find if I want to switch it. Overall it functions very well. Would definitely recommend.

I never could get an answer to why the weather temperature shown was in Celsius °C rather than °F. The audio would switch from my remote speaker to the watch. If I disconnect the watch by turning wifi off it works just fine."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,JGB,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent plus great battery life,5-Jun-23,"All the positive things people noted plus if you use it as a normal watch, not a toy by constantly playing with it, the battery can last three weeks as mine does. After two weeks, my battery is at 44%.My neighbor has an Apple watch, she keeps the display on at all times so it has to be charged every other day.Answering the phone on this watch works great, the voice is clear and other party hears you as well.Only complaint I have, instructions could be more complete how the different features work. Took a while how to figure out how to turn off the shake to turn on/off display feature. Shake-on is a neat feature to play with when new but this uses up the battery power and isn't necessary to view the time, just push the stem button. The shake feature will also will light up when you don't want it to, like in the night, moving in bed.I bought the silver one plus a metal silver band. Swapping the band is extremely simple. The pin can be installed with the built in lever or the old way, with a finger nail or knife bladeI bought a black version first, also a black metal band for it, the black will wear off at common wear points in a few months resulting in looking cheap looking watch so a silver watch with a silver metal band is a better choice when using metal bands. Below, the silver band I bought.FERNBE for Galaxy Watch 5 Band 40mm/44mm/Pro 45mm Compatible with Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 46mm/42mm Bands, 20mm Quick Release Stainless SteelLastly, this watch comes with a screen protector that is easy to remove by accident and throw away like I did my first black watch.Reminder, these watches are not approved medical devices so don't depend on it for accuracy except pulse seems pretty close."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,KC,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGood  watch for the price,6-Jul-23,"I have had the watch for a couple of weeks now and this is what I have found:STEPS: It seems to measure the movement of your arm and not actual steps. I wake up in the mornings having walked about 50 steps in my sleep. I don’t rely on it for accurate reporting.SLEEP: You can’t set your sleeping time; it is preset but somehow knows when you wake up. Could be all the arm movements. It doesn’t allow you to check your sleep by the hour, you only see the full night with indications of your sleeping pattern. I would like to see down to the hour how I slept. Plus, there are nights where it didn’t record so I am just going to assume I died and came back to life during those times.HEART RATE: It seems to be good. I check it while resting and while moving around and the BPM changes depending on the activity.BLOOD OXYGEN: This isn’t monitored continuously or intermittently as far as I can tell. I have not found a setting that will do that. You have to manually access that part of the APP or watch APP and tell it to check the oxygen level.If you have the phone enabled on the watch, then anything you play on your phone will automatically start playing on the watch instead. It has to be manually turned off and on via the watch. It’s a nuisance so I just keep the phone disabled on the watch.If it happens to disconnect from Bluetooth, the only way I have found to get it to reconnect is to disconnect all other devices such as earbuds, etc. and remove the watch as well then turn off Bluetooth. Then you can turn it back on and scan for devices and reconnect everything. It’s a pain and has only done this to me twice in the past 2 weeks.Another super annoying issue is when I get in my car my phone suddenly starts pinging me every 15 seconds to see if I want to pair the watch to my vehicle. That happened twice and was SUPER annoying. Now when I get in my vehicle, I know to disconnect the watch or just turn Bluetooth off on my phone altogether.Bottom line, it’s my first smart watch and I like having this information available to me. But when I decide to upgrade, I will definitely look for one that uses GPS for steps, has more detailed information along with more continuous monitoring options."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,christy,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsI love this watch,7-Jan-23,"Its the first time I'm buying a watch for myself I've bought my son apple watches and seeing the productivity of them, I couldn't see spending more money on a Samsung watch for myself so I finally decided to at least try something for myself. I am absolutely impressed with what I've purchased. They all work the same some better than others but this watch I totally recommend. I'm so happy I didn't spend $300+ on something that does the same exact thing as pretty watch.  Thank you for making a great product"

And they all seem to be fine the only thing is be careful because if you get a new phone You better disconnect your old phone completely from the app. I got a new phone and was on aware that I could not connect to my watch to my new phone every time I tried to connect it Wouldn't take. I got it so I could receive phone calls but nothing else it was kind of weird it still tells time but it doesn't go through my phone. I've got I think warranty  Maybe they'll exchange it so I hope they do I bought a lot of these . !!!! Update finally got it to connect ended up going to Da Fit app. Don't know if that's what did it but now I can even get my local weather! I'm in love with this again, glad I didn't have to send this back."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Rian Keyes,3.0 out of 5 stars,"3.0 out of 5 starsNot user friendly, but was what it claimed to be",9-Oct-23,"This was a purchase for my 72 year old mother to be used in case of falling and needing a way to call for help.  That said, I am not sure this watch would be a good fit for anyone who is not extremely comfortable with different touch screen sensitivity and for products that don't seem to focus on ""end user experience"".In short - my mother eventually fried the watch by taking it in a sauna, which as she is using it in case she falls does not inspire us to purchase it again.The watch touchscreen is way to sensitive one second and then doesn't really respond to touch the next.  I found that when I was helping set up the watch I was constantly frustrated that it wouldn't do what I was trying to do.  The scrolling is miserable most of the time, and lack of customization means that in order to get to the apps you want to access, most of the time involves a lot of failed scrolling attempts.Connecting the watch to the phone was simple, until it turned off  but this was not a large problem and one that can easily be navigated for the price. (I am aware this is not a high end watch so realize my expectations were not that it would do EVERYTHING perfectly)The app was mediocre - it could have been worse, but I found connecting contacts was disappointing.  I can see my contacts in the phone yet only a handful would show up in the app (which is the only way to make quick contacts for the watch)  after a dozen refreshes and closing of the app we were able to get 1 of the 3 contacts we wanted to show up and just ignored the other two.I would not recommend this product for someone who has a real need for a smartwatch.  The price is good which was a big plus, just manage your expectations.  This watch would be great for someone who is on a budget and really wants more of a watch with some features than a ""smart watch""."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,A.W. ,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat watch with one flaw,10-Oct-23,"I generally do not write reviews, but I thought this bit of information may help some other people. This is a great watch! Truly just as described. Easy set up within minutes. However, there is 1 design flaw that even customer service couldn't get me around. When you have the phone setting turned on on the watch to make and receive calls, unfortunately all the sound from your phone (videos, notification sounds, music etc) will automatically come from your watch also. So that means if your watch is connected by Bluetooth, even if you're not wearing it but it's close enough in proximity to you, you will get no sound from your phone at all. It will all come through the watch. Customer service says to turn off the phone setting on the watch in order for sound to come from your phone. However, if you turn off the phone setting, then you cannot make and receive calls on the watch - which would defeat the purpose of one of its main features. I found this SUPER annoying and was just about to return it when I figured out the solution. So....the way around it is this: under device control, choose your watch, click device settings and turn off the media toggle. Now all the sound comes from your phone and you can still make and receive calls on your watch. Hope this helps others who may be experiencing the same problem. Only wish customer service had been more knowledgeable about this."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat start off watch,11-Sep-23,"If you want something that’s affordable with a lot of features. Get this watch. You can talk from it, listen to music, set your own photos, and the battery life last days. It comes with its own app that you can link to your iPhone. My only issue is with daily wear it can make your wrist hurt and peel. It will even cause discoloration in the spot that it irritates. So if you have sensitive skin. Beware. You can change the band. But I’m not sure where you will find one. It is the size of a normal size watch. I got many compliments on it too. I loved the watch so much I bought my friend one. So I definitely would suggest if you want something practical, affordable and easy to use."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Diana V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsBest Budget Smart Watch,12-Jan-23,"I have been wearing this to work for about 2 and a half weeks. I chose this watch because of the features. I am a dog groomer which can be a physically demanding job. I  needed something that can receive calls and text notifications for when I am too busy to look at my phone. I needed it to be water resistant for baths. And it needs to have a good battery life. This watch not only does all of those things, I can answer phone calls, I can make calls, I can listen to music and app sounds from my watch. The sports features never really tested because I didn't want it for that reason. I do see that the stepping count is not accurate but I really only needed it to tell me time and to receive any emergency calls I may not reach or hear. If you want smart watches that are accurate in calculating health stuff, maybe invest in something more reliable. But if your looking for a watch that tells time, has alarms and timers, receives calls and text notifications, makes calls, and plays music, then this is for you. Why waste hundreds of dollars on an apple watch when you can get the same basic features and designs for hundreds of dollars cheaper ?"

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,CoryCory,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsIt actually works!,20-Aug-23,"I'll be honest I was prepared for it not to work great with not being a name brand watch that markets all their bells and whistles. But this watch is great! Starting with the physical watch, it's NOT heavy or bulking and the wrist band to it fits great and is so soft and smooth that it doesn't even irritate your skin when wearing it all day and night ❤️ onto the app is was extremely easy to download and connect to the watch and you have easy access to talk to customer service right there (no having to search for the contact option like almost every app/website and business) in the app you also have easy access to choose what you want you watch to do and all the things it can connect to, you can even control your music on it! Now to the watch functions, it's beyond easy to control, very clear, you can literally edit the watch to your liking and I love that, Ive now have a few calls and texts on my watch and it's great, the voice quality back and forth is great which also surprised me. Honestly 10 out of 10 I'd recommend this watch and their customer service is great and fast also! I almost forgot you can control your phones camera from it also which I tested out by setting up by phone and standing from a distance to have it take the picture which I'm very excited for, being a mom that is usually never in group photos now I can be in them and simple control it from my watch while posing! ❤️ And there's no delay unless you set a delay timer on your phone if wanted ❤️"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,cmwills,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars1st Smart Watch,21-Jun-23,"This is my first and only smart watch.I didn't want to pay big money for something I wasn't sure would be useful or that I would enjoy wearing. That is why I chose this watch.It connects to my phone through bluetooth for phone calls and text. Meaning, you can make and recieve phone calls through the watch. You can view texts and other phone alerts through the watch. You cannot send texts, but that doesn't bother me.The connection distance is good. It stays connected throughout my entire home when I don't have my phone on me.I enjoy the additional features like step monitoring, weather, spo2, heart rate, find phone, alarms, flashlight and different watch faces. The app has a a feature to chat with an agent if you need help which I have used.The band is comfortable. I chose the pink and it is a very light pink.One thing that I dislike is that when the watch is connected through the phone bluetooth, all sound is played through the watch. This includes games, videos, ads. I wish it had the intelligence to know that those sounds are not helpful through the watch. I end up having to disconnect the bluetooth when I don't want sound played through it. And that ends up disconnecting the watch and alerts from my phone completely. I don't know if other name brand smart watches have the ability to differentiate between the sounds. This is why I rated the watch 4 stars instead of 5.Overall, I am pleased with this for my first smart watch and recommend it."

(6) Has a sturdy wrist band.(7) The app is easy to download and to navigate.CONS: (1) The Bluetooth media output is wonky. If I'm wearing my watch and have my phone out, sometimes the phone audio will switch to the watch itself. Other times, if I put wireless earbuds in, turn my car Bluetooth on, etc., the audio will default to my watch. I have to manually go onto my phone settings to change the Bluetooth to wherever I actually want it.(2) The Bluetooth, in general, disconnects a couple times per day. I'll wonder why I haven't received notifications on my watch; it's because I have to go onto my phone, open the watch-app, and re-connect the devices.(3) The battery life runs down faster than the previous watch I owned. (To be fair, though, it HAS been 3 days since I charged it, and it's only at 60%.)"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Jonathan Poss,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSmartwatch/Health bracelet,23-Nov-23,"For the price this thing is amazing!!!!! It looks and responds every bit as good as the expensive name brand smart watches and I've bumped mine many times already while working on heavy machinery and not only has it not dinged or scratched but the screen protector that comes with it works flawlessly. My battery lasts me roughly 4-6 days, depending on how much I check my heart rate and stuff lol but still that's better than most of the big dog brands. My biggest concerns are mainly the app and I wish u could return text messages instead of only receiving them. It wouldn't be too hard to set up a numeric keypad  to send texts if nothing else like the one it uses to make phone calls. That way u wouldn't have to bother with trying to type on a full keyboard, u could just push the number 2 until it got to A, B, C or 2. Just a thought for the future lol. But I'm still very very happy with my watch for the price!!!!! The app needs to be where sleep time can be adjusted cause not all of us sit up 10pm and get up at 6am like it has preprogrammed. The app would be great if someone would just sit down and take the time to go over everything and work out all the kinks. I love that it takes my heart rate but honestly I wish it did blood pressure too or was optional on which one u wanted on ur watch. Make no mistake about it......... I highly recommend this product overall to anyone like me with limited means that want to enjoy the benefits of having a smartwatch/Health bracelet. I've had several for not much cheaper than this and they all done great for the price but this watch does as much as all my other ones together and was still at a very very good price!!!!!!!"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,TheOnlyAlaisaTheOnlyAlaisa,3.0 out of 5 stars3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsVery good for the money,5-Oct-23,"1.I LOVE the calling. It does so good even pretty far from my phone (I leave it in a locker at work) it does the same *important* things my boyfriends apple watch does. The sound is very clear and you don't have to have it right up by your face for the other person to hear you.2.It has find my phone (it rings your phone loudly)3.It has a customizable watch face.Again, it's very good for the use I got it. It's cheap and I'm a welder, so if it's gets broken it's easily replaceable.4. The battery life is very good.5. It plays music from your phone (however I've had issues with not being able to stop the music from my watch bc it says phone not connected, which isn't true.)Downsides: The BIGGEST downside is the app on your phone. It needs a serious upgrade. It constantly says not connected even though my Bluetooth is connected to the watch, so it's a pain trying to find out how to reconnect it.2.I can't get it to save my favorite contacts. It worked one time and when I restarted it to reconnect it, they disappeared.3. You can't reply to a text without using bixby voice (bixby is trash) so it doesn't work with a galaxy. There's not even standard text options like ""I'll call you back"" ""Ok"" ""Can't talk right now"" just your phones voice option (bixby or siri)"

I've used the guide to trouble shoot and have made sure the weather option in the app on my phone is turned on and that my watch is ""linked"" to my phone. I've not taken the time to contact the seller to ask questions for a remedy for the weather issue. To note: the ability to answer and make calls works great, as well as being able to receive text messages. Has anyone else had this issue with the weather app and been able to resolve it?"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Lora_K,2.0 out of 5 stars,"2.0 out of 5 starsDisappointed with form, function, and features.",15-Nov-23,"With all the 5-star reviews, I was hopeful that this watch would work better than the Xiaomi fitness tracker that I had tried for tracking my sleep patterns, as well as provide accurate recording of other metrics and handy features such as messages and weather.I was, however, disappointed. Also, I need to disclose that I received a message that offered me $30 if I left a 5-star review. That's more than half what I payed for the watch. I did not find that to be an incentive, I found that to be irritating.On the plus side, I did like how the watch was handling messages and phone calls.On the negative side:- The watch felt bulky and looked awkward on my tiny wrist.- Activating the screen often required pushing the button on the side; there was no way to tap the screen on. I found this to be surprisingly annoying.- The screen was decidedly less responsive than the first tracker I tried. Possibly because of the screen protector?- The bubble menu that you see in the pictures is somewhat hard to use, because 1) you have to know what all of those pictures mean, 2) you have to hunt for the one you want in the tightly-packed space, and 3) the ones at the edges are shrunk as you maneuver around the menu area, making them even harder to see.- As far as I could find, there were few if any customization options for the menus. You're stuck with the full bubble menu layout, you're stuck with all the workout options in the same order, you're stuck with whatever shortcuts they provide - or don't provide.- Also, the offerings for different watch faces in the app were mostly cute backgrounds with just the time, or maybe time and steps. The few faces that had robust displays of data were so crammed that they were hard to read. The only one that I found that was nicely readable didn't bother to include the outside temperature, which I wanted to be able to check before going out for a walk.- And finally, the sleep tracking was worse than the one I returned. I was awake and up several times through the night, but the tracker didn't record the times I got up. If a tracker can't tell the difference between sleeping and walking to the bathroom, I don't trust its sleep analysis!After some more comparison shopping, I finally decided to try the Fitbit Charge 5. So far, I am very happy with it... but that's another review altogether!"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Ms Mama C,1.0 out of 5 stars,1.0 out of 5 starsSmart watch or is it?,15-Oct-23,"I've owned a fitbit watch for several years, two of them actually.  I wanted to upgrade to a smart watch but I didn't want to spend a fortune on one.My husband bought me this watch for my birthday.  I've owned it for 3 months as of the date of this review.Now, I'm not a high tech person so if you're looking for that type of review, stop reading here. But I'm going to share what I like and dislike about the watch and app though.For starters, I was excited to receive the watch as a gift.  The screen is large.  I liked the rose gold band.  Over all the screen is pretty easy to navigate and fairly straight forward.The HuaWise app which I downloaded from the Google playstore is a pain in the rear though.  Oddly enough when I downloaded the app my phone lost its data connection and it took hours before it returned.  Maybe it was coincidental, but my phone has acted buggy ever since I put this app on my phone.  Jump ahead just 3 months and now the app crashes consistently.Some of the features I was looking forward to in a smart watch - being able to take a phone call when I'm biking or walking without pulling my phone out.  Reading a text - note:  you can not response to an SMS on this watch.  I also wanted a watch that would track my steps, get a fairly accurate heart rate, and O2 level.Well, after about 2 months, with no changes to the settings, the watch quit vibrating whenever I receive a text or phone call.  I can not figure out how to get this feature back, but quite honestly with the app crashing I'm probably going to stop using the watch anyway.One of the frustrating things for me as well is the Bluetooth features. When I'm in my car I can not have the bloothooth connected to the watch and my vehicle.  If it's on on the watch my phone will right through the watch and I can not override to take the call through my car.The app does not feature any type of calorie logging feature either which the fitbit app does.And as far as recording steps - I've got to swing my arm very forcefully for the watch to log my steps.The few things I like about the watch: ease of navigation, battery life is great, there's a flashlight, albeit not very bright, easy to navigate, large screen, and there are fun watch faces you can download.  The price point would be great if the watch worked and certain functions didn't override others or some just stop working altogether.Going back to the app, what good is it if it crashes?  It's not.So, with all that being said, I can not in good conscience recommend this watch to anyone!Wish I'd sent it back before the return period was over."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,MayraMayra,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsLove product., great customer service",14-Nov-23,"Depending on your desire for its use this is a great watch, I literally only got it because I. Am starting a new job having a 2 year old I wanted to be able to know if I was getting a call from my sitter without having to carry my phone in my pockets at all times. Fits perfect I ended up using the alarm for it and love it adjusted my screen to my sons picture and love it., make sure to scan the sqcode for you to get the app for it. Download was fast and easy the watch came it at 25% charge make sure to charge it when you get it so it makes it easy to do any changes it charges fast also And very durable. Do not shower with it or have in a room rich with steam not recommended. Working out with it is ok a little sweat wouldn’t hurt. Also I reached out to customer service and I don’t know if they work 24 hrs but I reached out to them around 9:30pm and they answered me right away so far no complaints I’m extremely happy with my purchase"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Jojo,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat purchase!,9-Oct-23,"I just received my watch and love it. I'm impressed with how easy it was to set up. Anything that I had a question about was easily clarified through tech support that is provided on the mobile phone app. The watch came 80% charged and didn't take much time to fully charge to 100%. I have an iPhone and simply used the camera to download the app. I followed the instructions to sync my phone and connect to Bluetooth. I was instructed by tech support on how to locate other on the mobile app  to personalized the settings which was simple. I immediately had my husband place a call and text message to assure the features were working to which they are. The only issue is the weather app is not giving accurate data but the tech assured me that's it's in the process of being fixed. However, I do not mind because there's so many other useful features. I also realized today that the step feature is not calculating accurately. It is definitely worth the cost. I wanted the features of an apple watch without paying a hefty price and I am satisfied with my purchase thus far."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Lora Marie Rogers-Sproat,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsNice,13-Sep-23,"It's nice, and when it stays paired it works ok. My notices are sporadic,  I quite relying on that all together.  When linked, I can answer calls, and dial. I have saved favorites a few times and they won't stay, so I gave up. I can listen to music so that's nice. Sleep tracker and all seems pretty on target, when connected."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Stacy Lee Sanders,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsWorked great at first,25-Aug-23,Think it has some glitches it comes on an awful lot just moving my hand to roll over in the middle of the night brings the screen on I had to set it for the screen time to be on for very little time so that I would turn off each time that it was turning on other than that it seems to be working just fine I use it to keep track of my walking and to check my heart rate and my sleeping I have nothing to compare it to though so I did not choose to hook it up to receive calls or anything because I didn't want it for that other than the glitching and the screen coming on and off all the time
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Diamond DeeDiamond Dee,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsBetter features than the more expensive watches at more than half the price,27-Sep-23,"I have been wanting to increase my physical activity as I have been starting to gain some pounds and to help with stiff joints.  I recently purchased one of those devices that you can track you heart rate and such.  Then someone was recently talking about fitness type watches such as this watch.  Because I am easily swayed back into laziness, I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a device that I may only use briefly.  After reading so many reviews on smart watches, this watch had best features than the more expensive watches that do the same and for more than half the price.I decided to give this a try and sorry that I waited so long to purchase.  Once you install the app on your phone, you can see everything from there and set your preferences that immediately transfer to the watch.  I love this watch, the price and the ease of use. I am so thrilled and can’t wait to see what other health areas that I can explore and improve on. I was paid to provide an honest review of the product and this is what I have seen so far."

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Kass,2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0 out of 5 starsNot what I was expecting,20-Nov-23,"I just got this watch today not too long ago, and I already have some things to say on it. For a 50 dollar watch I honestly expected better. I can't even connect my contacts over even with permission to access my contact... Really? Is anyone else having the same issue as this? I really don't understand why looking at the settings. I've sat down for like a good hour or two just trying to get some of my contacts over and it has been struggling. I even set down my phone while I went to do other work to let it just do its thing thinking maybe it was just slow... It really makes me glad I'm off today because I can't imagine trying to set this thing up with little to no instructions while worrying about getting ready for and getting to work on time. It really just came with a paper saying to download a certain app and when it came to tinkering with other things I was really on my own for it.I can still dial out, but I'd have to have those numbers either written down or memorized which kinda defeats the purpose of having that ""contacts"" tab and overall being able to see who is texting/calling me. I did figure out how to get the weather tab to work though, finally. I do like the idea that it can count how many stops you'd take, and it has other health tabs, but I really don't know how accurate it is. I'm off so I wasn't moving around a whole lot today, but it still reads 0 steps and my data for the health, from what I could tell, was all over the place.I did notice that I'd get notifications though other than just text messaging and calling which I liked. I can see more than just the few people who use my phone number. Tomorrow I go in to work though so we'll see how it does there."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Lee reviewsLee reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis watch receives text and it dials/Answers,15-Sep-23,"The watch is great. It receives text messages and also you can dial out and answer calls it. The watch has an app that you connect to on your smart phone. One thing you need to remember when you connect your Bluetooth they will be two different Bluetooth connections. There’s one that attaches the watch to the phone and there’s another one that attaches the calls that come in and out you must connect the second Bluetooth setting also to receive and make the phone calls. Both Bluetooth settings will have a similar name. Also if you are wearing AirPods, you only can connect either the AirPods or the sound call answer options either one of the two not both the second Bluetooth connection that connects the phone capability acts almost like an external speaker you can hear the call. Clearly it will play music through the watch. Imagine it like that , it also has fitness bike heart rate monitors, sleeping monitors, and many more things that you can use. This watch is worth the money that I paid for it and right now you can catch it on sale."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,C. J. Lovelace,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsIncredibly durable,13-Oct-23,"I’ve had the watch for several months. A few set up things I wish were different but overall have been very pleased with how it works and ease of integration with other apps. Love that I didn’t have to pay a ton to get something that works like it claims. The real reason this should get 10 stars is I lost the watch and looked for it for 3 days. Then recalled I had left it on the ledge of my hot tub. 72 hours submerged in the bottom of my hot tub and it still works like a charm. Didn’t even need to do the rice trick. Now I know it doesn’t claim to be 100% waterproof, but that’s pretty impressive to me."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Jonna Baker,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsNo issues with this watch,1-Sep-23,For the price it’s a good watch. Easy to use compatible with my Apple phone. Need a newer phone my previous iPhone was a 10 and that was not compatible. Several functions and face settings which I really like. Only down side is the band. Just not my style. I’ve ordered a new band so easy enough to solve. The face of the watch does scratch easy. You might want to purchase a face cover.
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,RRK,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsWill NOT Stay Connected,21-Nov-23,"About the only good thing I can say is music and calls are clear and easy to hear.... IF you can keep your phone connected.1) In a three hour period I had to reconnect 3 different times. Each time I had it set properly and everything work perfectly, it did not stay that way. The phone and music would revert back to my phone in a very short period of time. I had to go back and uninstall, reinstall the app, change the settings on the watch and in the app its self in my phone. That had a lot to do with why I bought it. Incredibly frustrating.2) But, the main reason I bought it was to check my o2. I have copd and I need to know if it drops below 80. The Min and Max is set to 96 through 100 and cannot be changed.I contacted customer service through the chat option (because I couldn't reach them any other way) about these two issues. They never responded to my question about losing the connection and very bluntly told me the o2 settings could not be changed.I was so excited about buying this watch and I'm so disappointed with it. I'll be returning it."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,sb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starslots of features, tells time accurately, and looks great",8-Sep-23,"I was impressed from the moment I opened the box. Right on top was 'an extra' screen saver. I examined the watch and sure enough, it had a screen saver already applied. I've had it for a couple of months now. I was surprised by all the features. The band is soft and comfortable. I questioned the battery life, in the beginning, I had to charge it after 3 days, but realized I had the brightness turned up full blast. I turned it down to about 1/3 brightness and can see the readouts just as clearly. Now I only charge it about every 5 days.There are not a lot of written instructions explaining the different features. I have a samsung watch but its really heavy so wanted something lighter  on my arm. Even though I was used to using a digital watch, I still had question after question as I explored and played with the watch. The customer service is via texting and they replied promptly and helpfully each time, even when I had trouble following their very accurate and precise instructions. They didnt give up looking for solutions to my problem. I wanted the watch to stop playing music - the tech walked me through the steps over and over until I figured it out. For the money, I've very satisfied."

The pairing was so difficult unnecessarily. I had to reset the watch a few times and had to delete and read the app over again just to pair it. So far now that it is paired, I can receive calls and people can hear me clearly on watch. My husband has huge hands and usually the bigger watches are odd looking and this one is a happy medium. Had mine next to an Apple watch and the only difference was the sides."

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Kindle CustomerKindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsBetter quality than I expected,25-Oct-23,I am very pleased with this purchase.  I purchase a fitness watch from another company that I was so disappointed that I threw it away after one week.  I love this fit watch.  It looks and functions like the apple watch.  I was pleasantly surprised when i walked away from my desk and did not have my sell phone and it rang. The thing I'm most pleased with about this one is that I didn't have to take it apart to charge it.  The charger connects like a magnet to the back of the watch face.  I also like fact that it is easy to connect with a representative with questions by direct messaging and get an almost immediate response.
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Schoolbook,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsGreat watch, especially for the price",14-Oct-23,"I bought this watch to see if I would use a smart watch before I paid for one that was more expensive. I not only did not buy the expensive watch, I bought a second one of this model after I left the first one in a TSA bin in Rome. It does everything I need, it’s comfortable and low profile on my wrist and has synced with my phone without any issues. I have to disable the Bluetooth when in my car so it’s not the primary device, but that’s not a big deal. I receive messages on it but you can’t answer on the watch, which is fine for me. Overall, I really like this watch."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Mrs. Irvine,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGets Better,13-Oct-23,At first I hated this watch. It was hard to figure out and set up. It was a gift for my husband and it took both us 2 days on trying get it set up. One it is set up it’s great! You can receive & call people. You can receive messages. That was the main reason I bought was so he gets the notification right then and there. I think it was worth the buy. It was a struggle but it got better.

I love it so far with the app you have to download with it. I just received it so ama play with it a little more to try to find out things about it before I send it back. But things I didn’t mention is a plus and works very well. I’ll be writing an update after I figure this outUPDATE:so all the settings is on the watch not the phone really. Omg this watch is a must y’all I promise y’all won’t regret it…"

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Big Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsWay more accurate than my last fitness watch,30-Oct-23,"Ive never owned an apple watch or a fitbit so I can't compare it to those, but then those are in a whole different price range. I can compare it to another watch I bought from Amazon recently. The other watch was nice looking enough and had a bunch of features for just $35, just none of those features worked well. This watch, however has more features and they all work pretty well. The sleep tracker function actually seemed accurate, the heart rate monitor and blood oxygen agreed with my spo2 meter, and after I adjusted my stride length in the app, the step counter was close. The flashlight mode (just turns the screen on white at max brightness) is usable to see around indoors and not trip over the dog. I just tried the breathing/meditation mode, to see what that's all about, and it just helps you pace your breathing. As someone prone to anxiety attacks occasionally, that could be useful. I'm really liking this watch thus far, this is one of those cases where you pay a little more and get a lot more."

This $30 watch has a long lasting battery and does everything I was hoping my Apple Watch would do. This is a great find. I’m glad it came with a free screen protector too. It was very easy to set up and now I can track all my fitness information along with other benefits like receiving my messages on my watch or making calls. It also tracks the weather for me and does a handful of other things."

The app was super easy to set up, has ALL the functions as a Samsung or Apple watch and since receiving mine, my mom, aunt and daughter have all bought one. My daughter has a Samsung watch, the previous version to the newest and she switched!! I absolutely recommend this!! If u are new to Bluetooth watches, this is a GREAT first one to see if and how u use it."

To my surprise, I like my DXPICR Smartwatch a lot more than I expected.  I especially enjoy the features like changing watch faces; screen timeout setting; and voice assistant.  I also enjoy using HuaWise Fit app.  It is easy to use.  I like this app that includes User Manual, Binding Guide, 24-hr Customer Service, and offers 12-month Warranty.  The shipment was quick.  It only took 2 days from the time I placed the order to delivery.  For anyone who is looking for an awesome Smartwatch with a reasonable price, I highly recommend getting this DXPICR Smartwatch!"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0 out of 5 starsIt's Okay,7-Sep-23,"You know the saying. You get what you pay for. The device is constantly going out of sync with my phone. Tonight it lost about an hour and a half with time, then out of the blue it synced with the time on my phone. I would say on average the watch gets about 50% of the phone notifications. I bought this thinking it would be more discreet to look at the watch when texts or emails would come in. The only feature that seems to work reasonably is the step counter. Since it is so inexpensive, I decided to keep it for a step counter and continue to have my phone on my desk so I don't miss important texts or calls.Update:  after using this device for about a month, I felt I needed to lower the rating to two stars. The watch will not hold a charge any longer and the only functions that work are the step counter and heart rate. It does not send any texts, calls, or email alerts from my phone."

You must download the app to get the watch paired. Now getting notifications is accurate. The let down is only able to respond to messages through Siri or Google Assistant by pressing the AI on the watch. As of right now no you can't change the ring tone on the watch sounds like an old phone. The volume on the watch is amazing for the price and size. You can personalize the watch face through the app. The app is user friendly also has a 24hr customer assistance chat you can ask questions and get quick answers. Hope this review helps you. Hope to be able to do an update later on see how it holds up."

It actually works and does everything that it says it does. It’s of great quality and you can tell just by looks and how it feels. Big screen makes it easy to read messages right from watch. I can also control my music from the watch. Monitors your heart rate and sp02 accurately! And you can actually accept calls directly from the watch! Awesome product! I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!

Not sure I logged my step “size” right when setting it up so I never know if I am getting an accurate step count?My major complaint is that the Bluetooth connection is kinda off. My iWatch aloud me to get notifications and sounds on my phone still while paired to my iWatch; however, when this watch is paired all of my phone sounds go right ti the watch..like Instagram video, Spotify, anything. It’s weird as heck so I just don’t turn “phone mode” on anymore, which kinda defeats a major purpose of receiving messages during my workday discretely  and not having to check my actual phone."

The watch face will not stay set to the selected face.  Sometimes the alarms work and sometimes they don't, so not reliable to wake up.  The notifications work and it overrides my phone calls even if it is not turned on.  It was a replacement for a really good watch that broke after 3 years where the band holds, so had to get something new.  So far, not very pleased."

After reading the reviews I ordered this watch and have worn it along with my Fitbit step counter and this watch is definitely accurate on the steps. It also counts my weight lifting as steps but I don’t mind that because at least I’m still burning calories! My only complaint is that when I paired the watch with my phone it somehow called my mom when I was in the shower, so I disabled that function ha! But I love seeing text messages come in and can check the weather as well. I’m very happy with this watch!"

One of the great things about this watch is 24hr customer service at your fingertips within the provided application.  This watch had a more intuitive application and was easy to implement.  As with all new electronics there will always be a learning curve as it was no different with this watch.  It did not take long to learn the various functions.  Really like the ease of changing the watch screen and the ability to download your own picture for a more personalized look.  The watch is slim, not bulky and obtrusive and is very comfortable to wear.  I had this watch a few days now and very happy with it.  Also included are 2 screen protectors of which one is already applied to watch face.  My wife also likes it so much that I will be ordering another one in pink!"

I looked and compared and came across this one and found the reviews to contain very positive information about the functions. It tracks my steps, I can receive and make calls, I can receive texts, you can send texts by using the AI voice function, control shutter for camera, listen to music and the volume is decent. So much more, but these are the main ones I was excited for.I did order watch and that watch for some reason quit connecting to phone after a couple of weeks, so I was unable to use all the functions. I contacted support via the app and they were very helpful and offered to replace my watch at no cost. Received the new one just a few days ago. I’m quite content."

I already have a fitbit versa 2 and this watch is just as good, maybe better. I love the call feature. I can make and answer calls directly on my watch. Setting the watch up literally took minutes. It was super easy. The only feature that could make this watch any better would be if I could respond to text messages on it like I could my fitbit. However, I like the calling feature better which I did not have with the fitbit. I would definitely recommend it to anybody in the market for a smartwatch."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,James Jackson,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat first time Smart Watch,5-Oct-23,"Great first time Smart Watch for new users.The applications that I use work very well. 6 ~ 7 days before recharging, great. Setting the volume was difficult due to lack of instructions.Need better and more instructions.Shaking to activate display doesn’t work very well. Messages/ notifications work sometimes. Have to open app on phone each day to get weather info on watch to work.Overall, great first smartwatch for me. ✔️👍🏼👌🏼🙏🏼"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,mmancuso,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Quality!,10-Nov-23,I love that this watch/tracker can hold up to anything. I work in an office and am constantly bumping it on my desk or file cabinets and it still looks brand new! I only have to charge it once every 1-2 weeks and love the added heart rate and O2 saturation features. Highly recommended!

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Marian,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsComfortable watch,14-Nov-23,"This watch is easy to wear. Battery has about 5-6 day usage. To get immediate reading, press watch head into wrist and get desired choice update score. It thinks when I crochet that I am walking. :(  that’s the biggest downside that I’ve found. I like the watch for its worth."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsThis is better than I expected and app is easy to use,28-Aug-23,Dislike the band it’s too large and comes out of holders too easily my wrists are small I ordered some with quick release i hope they work better. I really like the watch you can even add your own photo for watch face/dial.
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,ErikaErika,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGood for what it is,12-Nov-23,"I had a fitbit before this but wanted a bigger screen but didnt want to pay the 200$ price tag of a samsung brand. This watch & band is actually quite comfortable. My boney boyfriend (who has never worn a smart watch or any watch for that matter, thought it was uncomfortable) but i like it. Its not too bulky like i thought it would be, as i have tiny hands for an adult. The band itself is a nice velvety rubber with a metal clasp that doesnt feel or look cheap. The interface is okay- still getting used to it. Wish you could customize what options you get when you swipe in any direction. I do however love that you can make calls and talk on the watch itself which is why i got this one vs another. For less than $50 i am very happy with my purchase."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Chermignon,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsIntel to China? (Where wach is from),16-Nov-23,"Strangest thing, every time I take a photo with my cell phone this watch app lights up and a green band circles the face of the phone at the exact same time as if it's capturing my photo even though that feature is completely turned off on the watch app. Obviously like most apps , you have to allow it access to everything on your phone which is obviously a risk. Otherwise all the functions work as expected"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,ChainsawChainsaw,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsPerfect for what I need,12-Nov-23,"For the money, this watch is perfect. I have an iPhone and it works exactly the way I need it. I run a custom weld shop so 10-12 hours a day is spent with sparks, dust, grinding, welding etc. and the watch holds up. It’s loud where I work and i can never hear my phone when management or a customer calls and this has been a game changer for me. Battery life seems good, all the functions that it claims have worked well for me so far so I have zero complaints."

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Clarabell,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsI would give a 5 start but stopped. O,20-Sep-23,I have loved this watch.  I've had it 5 months an it just stopped working.I ordered new bands an face covers yesterday n last night  it wouldn't charge an its dead.  I'm sick about it. There isn't much negative I have about it.I know it says a 12 month warranty with recite which I have as I bought it on Amazon.Does anyone have suggestions of what I can do?I'd appreciate any kind of helpThank you
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Great value for the price and was able to fix my items without any problems ,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsWas for a gift,6-Sep-23,Was perfect
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Patricia Medina,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat for the price,10-Nov-23,For the most part the watch works.  The heart rate monitor does not work correctly and the activities feature does not record your time/steps.
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,DavidDavid,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsBeautifully made watch,19-Nov-23,"it took me a bit to figure it out. After playing with it for a while it gets easier You can dial out but you can’t message from the watch. There’s only one game and stil haven’t figure if you can get more on it.I made sure I read the manual. For the price you pay, you’re getting a lot. It’s stylish, sleek with a nice big screen. The watch itself is rose gold with a blush pink band. The only downfall for me is the band. I have a small wrist and i have it on the last hole. Other than that I would recommend this watch if you don’t want to spend the money on an apple watch."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,BC,2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0 out of 5 starsSensitive and finicky,5-Oct-23,"Too sensitive to touch, so much so it did a reset on me twice now bc it thought i chose that opinion. Also, the blue tooth connection is very poor quality.  Like 15 feet within the same room!  I just got it to read the time (works), VIEW texts and see incoming calls so that I didn't miss anything important like my kids school.  So far I have missed all calls but 2 over the span of 4 weeks.  Battery decent."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,LisaLisa,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsBe patient and take your time with the set up and navigation, after that, it's pretty easy",29-Sep-23,"I love the look of it and the function once I paced myself to get familiar and realized that the icons are sensitive and easy to miss upon touching. I am pleased with the function but wasn't so much with the discovering all the prompts and settings. However, after I found the settings and changed my time out to max, I was able to find all else and play around even downloading a cool skin.I'm using this watch for backup encouragement and improved fitness"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Porsha,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsThis watch is amazing! Has everything you need!,10-Sep-23,"The media could not be loaded.                 I love this watch so much, I got it because I started working out not long ago and it has literally everything I need on it plus more! Came wrapped to perfection, easy to set up, looks cute on my wrist and I love the pink color. Perfect for the girlies who like to workout out but still look stylish ☺️ It has Bluetooth to connect to my phone so I can listen to music on my runs and to answer my calls without going into my fanny pack for my phone. I love it  and you can’t beat the price honestly!"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Leanne T. Wilkins,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsBattery life is terrible,8-Oct-23,I like the watch. Does everything it claims but I’m finding battery only lasts about 2 days before it needs to be charged again.

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Kimberly McCrery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5.0 out of 5 starsStats, phone, and music all in one.",9-Oct-23,"I bought this mainly for the phone usage on it. To be able to accept and make calls. For one, it sounds amazing on the other line, clear as day. Yet, it doesn't have that long of range, which is fine. The battery life is great! I haven't charged it since yesterday at 2pm for 20 minuets when I got it, and it still have 48% life at midnight today. The mobile app is great too. It keeps track of all the stats the watch takes. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels. I didn't know about the Spo2 taking. I love this feature as i have bad asthma. So to be able to always have my o2 levels on hand is perfection.All in all, I would highly recommend this watch!!"
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,David,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsbattery life is great,10-Oct-23,"My wife and I bought the two and they work great even as a phone. The side button on mine stopped working and so I will see how the company does on the year warrenty, I bought them 6 months ago so the year warrenty is still active. I will right another review after the issue is dealt with if I get a replacement or not. Other than that issue I think it is a great watch for the price."

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,D. Sykes,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSwift 24-hour Online Support,25-Oct-23,"I initially downloaded the Fitness Tracker (Da Fit), which made setting the phone up extremely difficult.  I then uninstalled the DaFit app and installed the HuaWise Fit app to set up the phone and its features.  After setting up my phone, I noticed that when I played a video on my phone, the video sound came through my watch versus my phone.  I contacted the HuaWise 24-hour Online Support and had a rep assist me within seconds.  The problem was fixed."
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,anniem,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsSurprisingly good!,15-Nov-23,I did not expect much for this price on Prime Day.  Pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  The best part is not having to hold a phone to my ear.

B09W52WZKT,Watch D,Ashley Kempen ,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat quality for the price,19-Oct-23,I didn’t want to spend all the money for one of those fancy Apple Watches and so I decided you know what I’ll try this one it connect to your phone and allows you to get you message. I have heart issues as will so I love that I can check my heart rate with it as well. It’s exact but compared to my devices it’s pretty dang close. Honestly you wanting one of those expensive watches this is a great alternative it’s just as nice and sleek while also having similar features.
B09W52WZKT,Watch D,mstlove1mstlove1,5.0 out of 5 stars5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat for the price....,26-Oct-23,"I've only had this for a few days and it took a while for me to get it to finally connect to my phone for calls, etc.  however, it does work.. the battery for me has lasted almost 2 full days without a charge.  I have not made a call on it, but I have switched to it while talking on a call and I could hear my dad well and he could hear me clearly he said...  The app makes it easy to manage... I have seen the fitness tracker working however I cannot tell how accurate.  The chat for help on the app worked fairly well too.  Overall for the price I am very impressed.  I have an android.... Samsung22 Ultra and its working well with it.  I would recommend."
